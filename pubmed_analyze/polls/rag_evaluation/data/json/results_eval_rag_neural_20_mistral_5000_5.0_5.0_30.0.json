Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects.

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and demyelination of CNS neurons. Up to now, there are many therapeutic strategies for MS but they are only being able to reduce progression of diseases and have not got any effect on repair and remyelination. Stem cell therapy is an appropriate method for regeneration but has limitations and problems. So recently, researches were used of exosomes that facilitate intercellular communication and transfer cell-to-cell biological information. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that we can used to their dysregulation in order to diseases diagnosis. The miRNAs of microvesicles obtained stem cells may change the fate of transplanted cells based on received signals of injured regions. The miRNAs existing in MSCs may be displayed the cell type and their biological activities. Current studies show also that the miRNAs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells. In the present review, firstly we discuss the role of miRNAs dysregulation in MS patients and miRNAs expression by stem cells. Finally, in this study was confirmed the relationship of microRNAs involved in MS and miRNAs expressed by stem cells and interaction between them in order to find appropriate treatment methods in future for limit to disability progression.",

Despite advances in the understanding of MS pathophysiology, effective treatments remain limited. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained attention as a potential therapeutic option due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. This review examines MS pathogenesis, emphasizing the role of immune cells, particularly T cells, in disease progression, and explores MSCs' therapeutic potential. Although preclinical studies in animal models show MSC efficacy, challenges such as donor variability, culture conditions, migratory capacity, and immunological compatibility hinder widespread clinical adoption. Strategies like genetic modification, optimized delivery methods, and advanced manufacturing are critical to overcoming these obstacles. Further research is needed to validate MSCs' clinical application in MS therapy.",

        "expected_abstract": "There is wide variation in the time from the onset to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and some controversy regarding the clinical characteristics of the courses (phenotypes) of MS. The present study aimed to characterize demographic and clinical factors that potentially influence long-term disability progression in the cohort of Latvian MS patients. A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients. Despite the small differences regarding the first MS symptoms, the disability outcomes in the cohort of Latvian patients are similar to other regions of the world.",

Significant differences in time to reach an Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) of 3.0 and 6.0 were observed based on demographics and onset topography. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the onset with optic or supratentorial symptoms is linked to a longer time until EDSS = 3.0 is reached. Urban origin correlated with a prolonged time until EDSS = 3.0. Gender and environment showed no significant associations with the hazard of reaching an EDSS = 6.0. Cox regression analysis revealed no significant impact of relapses on the time to reach EDSS scores of 3.0 and 6.0 in our study cohort.Conclusions:Multivariate analysis identified several predictive factors for disability progression, including environment, age at onset, and disability level at DMT initiation.",

        "expected_abstract": "Objectives:B cells are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",
        "found_abstract": "Depletion of circulating B lymphocytes using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) greatly reduces inflammatory activity in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS); it reduces progression to a lesser extent in nonrelapsing progressive MS. Mechanisms whereby anti-CD20 mAbs reduce MRI and clinical relapse activity in people with RMS are still being elucidated. Anti-CD20 agents do not fully protect from nonrelapsing disease progression, possibly due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inability to ameliorate the full extent of biology of MS progression. Anti-CD20 mAbs have a relatively favorable safety profile, at least in the short-term. Long-term safety studies are still needed.",
        "response": "CD11c+ B cells play a central role in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), contributing to inflammation, cytokine production, and abnormal immunoglobulin production. Anti-CD20 therapy, which depletes CD20+B cells, is effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging but can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (PR) forms of MS. The mechanisms whereby anti-CD20 therapy reduces inflammatory activity in RRMS are still being elucidated, and it does not fully protect from nonrelapsing disease progression in PRMS due to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier and ameliorate the full extent of MS progression."

        "expected_abstract": "Background and objectives:Chronic inflammation may contribute to cognitive dysfunction and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",
        "found_abstract": "Background and objective:We explored dynamic changes in the choroid plexus (CP) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and assessed its relationship with chronic lesion expansion and atrophy in various brain compartments. Methods:Fifty-seven RRMS patients were annually assessed for a minimum of 48 months with 3D FLAIR, pre- and post-contrast 3D T1 and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The CP was manually segmented at baseline and last follow-up. Results:The volume of CP significantly increased by 1.4% annually. However, the extent of CP enlargement varied considerably among individuals (ranging from -3.6 to 150.8 mm3or -0.2% to 6.3%). The magnitude of CP enlargement significantly correlated with central (r= 0.70,p< 0.001) and total brain atrophy (r= -0.57,p< 0.001), white (r= -0.61,p< 0.001) and deep grey matter atrophy (r= -0.60,p< 0.001). Progressive CP enlargement was significantly associated with the volume and extent of chronic lesion expansion (r= 0.60,p< 0.001), but not with the number or volume of new lesions. Conclusion:This study provides evidence of progressive CP enlargement in patients with RRMS. Our findings also demonstrate that enlargement of the CP volume is linked to the expansion of chronic lesions and neurodegeneration of periventricular white and grey matter in RRMS patients.",
        "response": "The provided context suggests that choroid plexus enlargement and paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) may be related to cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS patients through neurodegeneration. The first abstract shows that chronic lesion expansion and neurodegeneration are associated with progressive CP enlargement. The second abstract demonstrates an independent association between thalamic volumes and processing speed and memory performance among pwMS, suggesting a role for thalamic atrophy in cognitive dysfunction. The third abstract indicates that intrathecal B cells might drive memory impairment in pwMS independently of brain damage visible on MRI scans. However, there is no direct evidence in the context linking PRLs specifically to cognitive impairment and fatigue."

Enpp2 encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin-activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility. Importantly, using two mouse models of MS, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor ameliorated EAE severity, decreased the number of CNS infiltrating T and B cells, and suppressed relapses, suggesting autotaxin may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.",

This neurological disorder damages nerve cell sheaths, with treatments focusing on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. Though MS lesion detection has been studied, limited attention has been paid to clinical analysis and computational risk factor prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %. Prediction: Sensitivity ranged from 76 % to 98 %, specificity from 65 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 62 % to 99 %. Segmentation: Accuracy ranged up to 96.7 %.

This study involved 446 MS patients who had a baseline MRI, at least two measurements of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and a 1-year follow-up. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) for model development and 2) for evaluation. Three descriptors: β1, β2, and EDSS(t), were related to baseline MRI parameters using regression and classification XGBoost models. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis enhanced model transparency by identifying influential features. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of AI in predicting MS progression using the proposed patient trajectories and baseline MRI scans, outperforming classic Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods. In conclusion, MS trajectory descriptors are crucial; incorporating AI analysis into MRI assessments presents promising opportunities to advance predictive capabilities.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of newly appearing lesions developing into SELs, and their correlation to clinical evolution and treatment. Methods:A retrospective analysis of a fingolimod trial in primary progressive MS (PPMS; INFORMS,NCT00731692) was undertaken. Data were available from 324 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans up to 3 years after screening. New lesions at year 1 were identified with convolutional neural networks, and SELs obtained through a deformation-based method. Clinical disability was assessed annually by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression.

However, the 2021 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS guidelines don't recommend routine SC MRI for disease monitoring. This study investigates the frequency of new asymptomatic and isolated SC lesions, exploring their potential to predict clinical activity and guide treatment decisions. Methods:We enrolled relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who underwent brain and SC MRI at baseline and after 12 months. New, enlarged, or gadolinium-enhanced (Gd+) lesions on MRI were considered disease activity markers. Clinical relapses and treatment changes observed 3 months after the 12-month MRI were analyzed using regression analysis, evaluating their association with worsening SC findings. Results:A total of 201 RRMS patients (56 males, 27.9%, mean age 42.5 ± 12.1 years, mean EDSS 2.7 ± 1.9) were included. Isolated worsening of T2 lesion burden in the SC occurred in 16 patients (8%), and 12 (6%) had Gd + lesions. Among patients without brain MRI activity (n = 138), regression analysis revealed a significant association between new Gd + SC lesions and clinical relapses within 3 months of the 12-month MRI (p = 0.024). Worsening SC findings (p = 0.021) and SC lesion enhancement (p = 0.046) emerged as key factors influencing disease-modifying therapy changes within 3 months in these patients. Notably, even without clinical symptoms, worsening SC findings significantly predicted treatment changes (p = 0.003).

This study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of Australian MS clinical specialists on managing FP in the context of MS. Methods:We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with nine neurologists and ten MS nurses across Australia who regularly provide care to pwMS of reproductive age. Interview topics examined current approaches to managing FP, availability of FP resources, and opportunities for improvement. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results:Two main themes emerged. First, 'inconsistent approaches in providing family planning', where neurologists and MS nurses recognised FP provision as essential but revealed differences in the content, timing and extent of FP discussions; conflicts between reproductive considerations and DMT prescriptions according to teratogenic risk; and variable implementation of interdisciplinary approaches. Second, 'barriers in providing family planning' emerged which included a lack of local information resources on FP, lack of contemporary data on safety of DMTs, and a range of patient and professional factors, including time constraints.
