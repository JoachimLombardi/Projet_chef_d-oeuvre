        "expected_abstract": "Background:Individual disease-modifying treatment (DMT) decisions might differ between female and male people with MS (pwMS). Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",

        "response": "1) Response to Abstract #1: The study suggests that women and individuals with lower education are less likely to be currently treated with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, after controlling for relevant variables, a small association between DMT treatment and better performance on tests of processing speed and fine motor dexterity was found. The reasons behind these disparities are yet to be investigated in future research, which may involve exploring employment status, health insurance coverage, or sex differences in risk tolerance.\n\n  2) Response to Abstract #2: In this study, the authors aim to compare individuals who have switched their DMTs with those who haven't, characterize the first DMT switch, and identify reasons and predictors for switching the first DMT in people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). The results indicate that switchers are more likely to have started on moderate-to-mild efficacy DMTs, had a shorter time on their initial DMT, and are more likely to be from an earlier calendar period. Among the most common reasons for discontinuing the first DMT were disease activity despite treatment, adverse events, and patient request. The study concludes that the initial use of moderate-to-mild efficacy DMTs is a significant predictor of DMT discontinuation in PwMS, suggesting a need for prospective treatment strategy trials."

A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients.

        "expected_abstract": "Objectives:B cells are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",
        "found_abstract": "Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) shows that inflammation starts early and progresses with age. B cells play a central role in this process, contributing to cytokine production, defective regulatory functions, and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system. Anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapies, which deplete CD20+B cells, are largely used in the treatment of both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (PR) forms of MS. Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+CD4+T cells and a high proportion of Ag+CD8+T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.",

However, the role of CD11c+ B cells in the context of anti-CD20 therapy on the progression of Multiple Sclerosis is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, so I can't answer with full certainty about their specific role in the context of MS progression or how they are affected by anti-CD20 therapy in terms of disease progression."

Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",

        "expected_abstract": "Medical research offers potential for disease prediction, like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This neurological disorder damages nerve cell sheaths, with treatments focusing on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. Though MS lesion detection has been studied, limited attention has been paid to clinical analysis and computational risk factor prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %.

        "found_abstract": "Medical research offers potential for disease prediction, like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This neurological disorder damages nerve cell sheaths, with treatments focusing on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. Though MS lesion detection has been studied, limited attention has been paid to clinical analysis and computational risk factor prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %. Prediction: Sensitivity ranged from 76 % to 98 %, specificity from 65 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 62 % to 99 %. Segmentation: Accuracy ranged up to 96.7 %.

Another challenge is ensuring model interpretability and transparency to gain clinician and patient trust in these methods. However, the future holds potential for open data initiatives, the implementation of federated learning solutions, and generative AI approaches to address challenges in model interpretability and transparency.\n\n   Furthermore, the literature shows that combining techniques can improve efficiency, exploiting their strengths for better overall performance. For instance, the study mentioned in abstract n°2 proposed new MS trajectory descriptors that could be employed in ML regressors and classifiers to predict patient evolution, outperforming classic Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods. This study also demonstrated the potential of AI in predicting MS progression using baseline MRI scans."

        "expected_abstract": "Background and purpose:Newly appearing lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) may evolve into chronically active, slowly expanding lesions (SELs), leading to sustained disability progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of newly appearing lesions developing into SELs, and their correlation to clinical evolution and treatment. Methods:A retrospective analysis of a fingolimod trial in primary progressive MS (PPMS; INFORMS,NCT00731692) was undertaken. Data were available from 324 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans up to 3 years after screening. New lesions at year 1 were identified with convolutional neural networks, and SELs obtained through a deformation-based method. Clinical disability was assessed annually by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression. Treated patients had lower volume and count of definite SELs (β = -0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.015; β = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions:Incident chronic active lesions are common in PPMS, and fingolimod treatment can reduce their number.",

        "response": " Based on the provided context, it can be observed that all three abstracts discuss slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\n\n   Abstract n°1 finds that among new lesions in primary progressive MS, 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. The study also indicates that fingolimod treatment can reduce the number of these SELs.\n\n   Abstract n°2 suggests that SELs are associated with disease activity and gray matter loss in relapse-onset MS. It further states that a higher number of SELs is associated with an increased risk of not achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) status and greater volume loss in the cortex and subcortical gray matter.\n\n   Abstract n°3 reveals that SELs have a lower myelin content relative to non-SELs without a difference in neurite measures. The study also shows that over time, SELs showed a greater decrease in apparent myelin water fraction, reflecting greater tissue injury.\n\nRegarding the query about the findings regarding newly appearing lesions in MS and their evolution into slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in the context of fingolimod treatment, we can find that from Abstract n°1, 37% of new lesions evolved into SELs and fingolimod treatment can reduce their number. However, the context does not provide information about the timeline for the evolution of newly appearing lesions into SELs or specific findings related to this transition in the context of fingolimod treatment."

        "expected_abstract": "Introduction:Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young adults worldwide, including in Iran, affects their whole life so common care is no longer effective. In this regard, context-based approaches should be considered for a holistic care delivery that accords with the patients' inputs. We aimed to explore patients' understanding of MS and their personal experiences of living with this disease. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 patients. These patients were selected using a purposive sampling method, and the data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings:Three main categories and nine subcategories were identified: Thunder and Lightning strike in the form of Displeasure, Social wrong beliefs, Experiences of Constraints, Interference with Life Stages and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future; Subtle Beam consisting of Extrinsic Light Radiation, Reflection of Individual Effort and Formation of a Rainbow by Resilience and Hope for a Bright Future. Conclusion:By offering multidimensional support, patients reported a shift from fear to a vibrant life. Although research often focuses on the negative aspects of MS, this study recognizes both positive and negative aspects. These findings can contribute to future interventional research. Patient or public contribution:During the explanation of research goals and consent acquisition, participants were reminded that sharing their experiences could provide valuable insights benefiting others coping with or at risk of the same disease. Additionally, during data analysis, codes extracted were reviewed and improved with active participant involvement.",
        "found_abstract": "Purpose:This systematic review sought to synthesise the qualitative literature exploring couples' experiences of dyadic coping, when one partner has Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Methods:The review protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO. Five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus) were searched for relevant papers from inception to January 2024. Seven hundred and ninety three papers were screened against pre-defined inclusion criteria. Data from 11 studies (n= 204) were quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist and included in the metasynthesis. Results:The synthesis resulted in four themes related to couples' experiences of coping with MS: dance of accommodation, a sense of unity, outside of us and evolving as a unit. Communication attunement was perceived as key for couples to maintain cohesion in the relationship. Developing a shared narrative around MS helped couples to align their perspectives and co-ordinate their coping. The findings suggest that many couples coped by consciously maintaining a focus in the present. The wider system of social supports also appeared to frame the couples unique dyadic coping process in specific ways. Conclusions:The findings from this synthesis provide support for the conceptualisation of MS as a shared experience to support couples' rehabilitation efforts.",
        "response": " I can identify two abstracts that contain qualitative studies exploring patients' experiences with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The key findings from these studies are summarized below:\n\n1. 'Couples' experiences of coping with Multiple Sclerosis: a qualitative systematic review and metasynthesis.' - The study found four themes related to couples' experiences of coping with MS: dance of accommodation, a sense of unity, outside of us, and evolving as a unit.
