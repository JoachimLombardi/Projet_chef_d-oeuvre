Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",

        "response": " Based on the provided context, miRNas play a potential role in stem cell therapy for treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) through several mechanisms. Firstly, miRNAs of microvesicles obtained from stem cells may change the fate of transplanted cells based on signals from injured regions (Abstract n°1). Secondly, miRNAs existing in Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) display their cell type and biological activities. Thirdly, miRNAs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells (Abstract n°1).\n\nMoreover, miRNAs have been suggested as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for MS diagnosis and treatment due to their role in regulating gene expression (Abstract n°3). Current strategies for miRNA-based therapies include miRNA restoration therapy using lentivirus expressing a specific type of miRNA and miRNA mimics, as well as miRNA inhibition therapy using antisense oligonucleotides, small molecule inhibitors, locked nucleic acids (LNAs), anti-miRNAs, and antagomirs (Abstract n°2).\n\nIn summary, miRNAs contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for MS by facilitating intercellular communication, changing the fate of transplanted cells, and acting as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers. The application of miRNA-based therapies is an active area of research, with current strategies including miRNA restoration therapy and miRNA inhibition therapy. However, there is a need for improved delivery methods and validation of therapeutic efficacy (Abstract n°2)."

        "expected_abstract": "There is wide variation in the time from the onset to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and some controversy regarding the clinical characteristics of the courses (phenotypes) of MS. The present study aimed to characterize demographic and clinical factors that potentially influence long-term disability progression in the cohort of Latvian MS patients. A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients. Despite the small differences regarding the first MS symptoms, the disability outcomes in the cohort of Latvian patients are similar to other regions of the world.",

The context of Abstract n°1 mentions that gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression but patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS value at the first visit. However, this abstract does not specifically focus on long-term disability progression.\n\nAbstract n°2 identifies three distinct disability trajectories: no/minimal, moderate and severe, and those in the moderate and severe disability trajectories experienced disability worsening. Compared with the no/minimal disability trajectory, those with older age, a higher number of relapses within the first 5 years post-FCD, and a higher number of comorbidities at baseline were more likely to be in the worse disability trajectory.\n\nAbstract n°3 develops a multistate model to quantify the influence of demographic, clinical, and imaging factors on disability worsening and disability improvement simultaneously across the disability spectrum as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Older age, time since first symptoms, and the number of relapses in the past year were confirmed as predictors of future disability worsening.\n\nTherefore, based on the context given, older age, a higher number of relapses within the first 5 years post-FCD, and a higher number of comorbidities at baseline are demographic and clinical factors that have been found to influence long-term disability progression in Latvian MS patients."

        "expected_abstract": "Objectives:B cells are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",
        "found_abstract": "Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) shows that inflammation starts early and progresses with age. B cells play a central role in this process, contributing to cytokine production, defective regulatory functions, and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system. Anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapies, which deplete CD20+B cells, are largely used in the treatment of both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (PR) forms of MS. Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+CD4+T cells and a high proportion of Ag+CD8+T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.",
        "response": " Based on the provided context, CD11c+ B cells play a role in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), specifically in relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MS. Anti-CD20 therapy, which depletes CD20+B cells, is used to treat both forms of MS, but it can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. The context also suggests that B cells contribute to inflammation in MS, including cytokine production and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system.\n\nAbstract n°3 provides additional information on CD11c+B cells in MS and their response to anti-CD20 therapy. The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy and comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions. However, the context does not provide specific information on how CD11c+ B cells are affected by anti-CD20 therapy in the context of MS or MS progression. Therefore, I can't answer with certainty how CD11c+B cells are affected by anti-CD20 therapy in terms of their role in MS and MS progression based on the provided context alone."

To determine the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and these diseases, researchers have employed a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach.\n\nThe results from the MR analysis of MS revealed that higher relative abundances of the genus Ruminococcus2 and Roseburia were associated with an increased risk of MS. Additionally, higher abundances of the class Mollicutes, genus Eubacterium (hallii group), phylum Tenericutes, genus Ruminococcaceae UCG005, genus Holdemania, genus Lachnoclostridium, and genus Eubacterium (ruminantium group) were linked to a greater probability of MS occurrence. No outliers were identified through sensitivity analysis, and the reverse MR analysis did not indicate any reverse causality.\n\nIn summary, based on the context provided, we can conclude that there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between specific alterations in the gut microbiome and the development of Multiple Sclerosis. The findings from the MR analysis provide novel insights into the mechanisms of MS that are mediated by gut microbiota."

Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",

Enpp2 encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin-activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility. Importantly, using two mouse models of MS, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor ameliorated EAE severity, decreased the number of CNS infiltrating T and B cells, and suppressed relapses, suggesting autotaxin may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.",

        "response": " Based on the provided context, I can answer the query as follows:\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have shown potential in improving the diagnosis and prediction of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a neurological disorder that damages nerve cell sheaths, and current treatments focus on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. AI/ML techniques offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression.\n\nThe challenges associated with implementing AI/ML in MS diagnosis and prediction include accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. Several studies have explored the use of AI/ML methods, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). These approaches have been suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve diagnostic accuracy.\n\nApplications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy.

AI analysis in MRI assessments presents promising opportunities to advance predictive capabilities, as demonstrated in a study that proposed new MS trajectory descriptors using only baseline MRI studies and explored the contribution of ML models in discerning these descriptors.\n\nDespite the promises of AI solutions, model interpretability and transparency remain critical for gaining clinician and patient trust in these methods. Future developments include open data initiatives, federated learning solutions, and generative AI approaches to address challenges in model interpretability and transparency."

        "query": "What were the findings regarding newly appearing lesions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and their evolution into slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in the context of fingolimod treatment?",
        "expected_abstract": "Background and purpose:Newly appearing lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) may evolve into chronically active, slowly expanding lesions (SELs), leading to sustained disability progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of newly appearing lesions developing into SELs, and their correlation to clinical evolution and treatment. Methods:A retrospective analysis of a fingolimod trial in primary progressive MS (PPMS; INFORMS,NCT00731692) was undertaken. Data were available from 324 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans up to 3 years after screening. New lesions at year 1 were identified with convolutional neural networks, and SELs obtained through a deformation-based method. Clinical disability was assessed annually by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression. Treated patients had lower volume and count of definite SELs (β = -0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.015; β = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions:Incident chronic active lesions are common in PPMS, and fingolimod treatment can reduce their number.",

        "response": " Based on the provided context, the first abstract (Abstract n°1) reports that among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who had newly appearing lesions at year 1, 37% of these new lesions evolved into slowly expanding lesions (SELs). The second abstract (Abstract n°2) indicates that Japanese patients with MS developed SELs during a 2-year observation period and that the number of SELs was negatively associated with volume changes in the cortex and subcortical gray matter, suggesting that SELs could be a biomarker of disease activity in MS. The third abstract (Abstract n°3) does not directly provide information regarding the findings of newly appearing lesions or their evolution into SELs during fingolimod treatment.\n\nTherefore, the context provides evidence that among patients with MS who had newly appearing lesions at year 1, a significant proportion evolved into SELs. However, it does not specify whether this finding is unique to the fingolimod treatment group or applicable to the MS population as a whole."

        "expected_abstract": "Introduction:Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young adults worldwide, including in Iran, affects their whole life so common care is no longer effective. In this regard, context-based approaches should be considered for a holistic care delivery that accords with the patients' inputs. We aimed to explore patients' understanding of MS and their personal experiences of living with this disease. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 patients. These patients were selected using a purposive sampling method, and the data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings:Three main categories and nine subcategories were identified: Thunder and Lightning strike in the form of Displeasure, Social wrong beliefs, Experiences of Constraints, Interference with Life Stages and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future; Subtle Beam consisting of Extrinsic Light Radiation, Reflection of Individual Effort and Formation of a Rainbow by Resilience and Hope for a Bright Future. Conclusion:By offering multidimensional support, patients reported a shift from fear to a vibrant life. Although research often focuses on the negative aspects of MS, this study recognizes both positive and negative aspects. These findings can contribute to future interventional research. Patient or public contribution:During the explanation of research goals and consent acquisition, participants were reminded that sharing their experiences could provide valuable insights benefiting others coping with or at risk of the same disease.
