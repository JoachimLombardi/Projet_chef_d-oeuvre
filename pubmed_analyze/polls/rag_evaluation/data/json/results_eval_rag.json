Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",

        "response": " The first abstract discusses a study that investigated the relationship between demographic factors, including gender and education level, and current treatment with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in people with mild cognitive impairment. The results suggest that women and those with lower education levels are less likely to be currently treated with DMTs. Furthermore, an independent, small association was found between DMT treatment and better performance on tests of processing speed and fine motor dexterity.\n\nThe second abstract describes a retrospective analysis of data from the German Multiple Sclerosis Registry, focusing on treatment switches among people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The study found that switchers and non-switchers differed in several aspects, including time to first DMT, education level, calendar period of first DMT start, initial DMT class, time on first DMT, and disease activity. Switchers were more likely to change to high-efficacy DMTs, while fewer switchers switched to mild-to-moderate efficacy DMTs. Common reasons for discontinuing the first DMT included disease activity, adverse events, and patient request. The initial use of mild-to-moderate efficacy DMTs was identified as a strong predictor of DMT discontinuation in this cohort."

The miRNAs existing in MSCs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells, and their dysregulation in MS patients has been studied for appropriate treatment methods in future for limiting disability progression (Abstract n°1). Additionally, MSCs have therapeutic potential for MS due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties, and recent studies suggest that MSCs exert their effects through extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from the cells, rather than direct cellular engraftment or differentiation. MSC-derived EVs demonstrate promising therapeutic effects for MS by reducing clinical scores and slowing down disease progression in animal models of MS through immunomodulation and suppressing harmful immune responses (Abstract n°3)."

It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",
        "found_abstract": "Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) shows that inflammation starts early and progresses with age. B cells play a central role in this process, contributing to cytokine production, defective regulatory functions, and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system. Anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapies, which deplete CD20+B cells, are largely used in the treatment of both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (PR) forms of MS. Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+CD4+T cells and a high proportion of Ag+CD8+T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.",

Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",

This neurological disorder damages nerve cell sheaths, with treatments focusing on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. Though MS lesion detection has been studied, limited attention has been paid to clinical analysis and computational risk factor prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %.

This neurological disorder damages nerve cell sheaths, with treatments focusing on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. Though MS lesion detection has been studied, limited attention has been paid to clinical analysis and computational risk factor prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %. Prediction: Sensitivity ranged from 76 % to 98 %, specificity from 65 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 62 % to 99 %. Segmentation: Accuracy ranged up to 96.7 %. Classification: Sensitivity ranged from 78 % to 97.34 %, specificity from 65 % to 99.32 %, and accuracy from 71 % to 97.94 %. Furthermore, the literature shows that combining techniques can improve efficiency, exploiting their strengths for better overall performance.",
        "response": " Based on the provided context, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can improve the diagnosis and prediction of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in several ways. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve diagnostic accuracy using methods like Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Furthermore, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy.\n\nFor prediction, AI/ML models have been employed to predict patient evolution using baseline MRI studies, and they outperform classic Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods. These MS trajectory descriptors are crucial for personalized patient management, and incorporating AI analysis into MRI assessments holds promising opportunities to advance predictive capabilities.\n\nHowever, challenges associated with the implementation of AI/ML in MS include accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. Additionally, ensuring model interpretability and transparency is essential for gaining clinician and patient trust in these methods. Future developments include open data initiatives, federated learning solutions, and generative AI approaches to address data sharing issues and challenges in model interpretability."

        "expected_abstract": "Background and purpose:Newly appearing lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) may evolve into chronically active, slowly expanding lesions (SELs), leading to sustained disability progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of newly appearing lesions developing into SELs, and their correlation to clinical evolution and treatment. Methods:A retrospective analysis of a fingolimod trial in primary progressive MS (PPMS; INFORMS,NCT00731692) was undertaken. Data were available from 324 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans up to 3 years after screening. New lesions at year 1 were identified with convolutional neural networks, and SELs obtained through a deformation-based method. Clinical disability was assessed annually by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression. Treated patients had lower volume and count of definite SELs (β = -0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.015; β = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions:Incident chronic active lesions are common in PPMS, and fingolimod treatment can reduce their number.",

        "response": " Based on the provided context, the first abstract suggests that among patients with MS who had newly appearing lesions at year 1, 37% of these new lesions evolved into definite or possible SELs. The study also found that higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression. Additionally, treated patients had lower volume and count of definite SELs compared to untreated patients.\n\nThe second abstract indicates that Japanese patients with MS developed SELs during a 2-year observation period and that the number of SELs was negatively associated with volume changes in the cortex and subcortical gray matter after correction for multiple comparisons, suggesting that SELs could be a biomarker of disease activity in MS.\n\nThe third abstract reports that SELs have a lower myelin content relative to non-SELs without a difference in neurite measures but show greater tissue injury longitudinally based on ViSTa measurements. However, the context does not provide information regarding the findings of this study regarding the evolution of newly appearing lesions into SELs during fingolimod treatment.\n\nI can't answer with the provided context whether there are any specific findings in the context regarding the evolution of newly appearing lesions into SELs and their relationship to clinical disability during fingolimab treatment."

        "query": "What were the key findings of the qualitative study exploring patients' experiences and understanding of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?",
        "expected_abstract": "Introduction:Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young adults worldwide, including in Iran, affects their whole life so common care is no longer effective. In this regard, context-based approaches should be considered for a holistic care delivery that accords with the patients' inputs. We aimed to explore patients' understanding of MS and their personal experiences of living with this disease. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 patients. These patients were selected using a purposive sampling method, and the data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings:Three main categories and nine subcategories were identified: Thunder and Lightning strike in the form of Displeasure, Social wrong beliefs, Experiences of Constraints, Interference with Life Stages and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future; Subtle Beam consisting of Extrinsic Light Radiation, Reflection of Individual Effort and Formation of a Rainbow by Resilience and Hope for a Bright Future. Conclusion:By offering multidimensional support, patients reported a shift from fear to a vibrant life. Although research often focuses on the negative aspects of MS, this study recognizes both positive and negative aspects. These findings can contribute to future interventional research. Patient or public contribution:During the explanation of research goals and consent acquisition, participants were reminded that sharing their experiences could provide valuable insights benefiting others coping with or at risk of the same disease. Additionally, during data analysis, codes extracted were reviewed and improved with active participant involvement.",
        "found_abstract": "Purpose:This systematic review sought to synthesise the qualitative literature exploring couples' experiences of dyadic coping, when one partner has Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Methods:The review protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO. Five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus) were searched for relevant papers from inception to January 2024. Seven hundred and ninety three papers were screened against pre-defined inclusion criteria. Data from 11 studies (n= 204) were quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist and included in the metasynthesis. Results:The synthesis resulted in four themes related to couples' experiences of coping with MS: dance of accommodation, a sense of unity, outside of us and evolving as a unit. Communication attunement was perceived as key for couples to maintain cohesion in the relationship. Developing a shared narrative around MS helped couples to align their perspectives and co-ordinate their coping. The findings suggest that many couples coped by consciously maintaining a focus in the present. The wider system of social supports also appeared to frame the couples unique dyadic coping process in specific ways. Conclusions:The findings from this synthesis provide support for the conceptualisation of MS as a shared experience to support couples' rehabilitation efforts.",
        "response": " Based on the provided context, the key findings of Abstract n°1 related to couples' experiences of coping with MS include: the importance of communication attunement for maintaining cohesion in relationships, developing a shared narrative around MS to align perspectives and coordinate coping efforts, and the role of present focus and social supports in couples' dyadic coping process.\n\nAbstract n°2 explored the experiences of people with relapsing-remitting MS regarding symptoms and impacts on daily life. The most bothersome symptoms identified were fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, mobility/difficulty walking, and vision problems. The most commonly reported impacts on daily life were balance problems/instability, work life/productivity, difficulty walking, daily activities/household chores, and leisure activities. A conceptual model was developed capturing disease symptoms, impairments, and identified impacts from interviews and literature search, which underpins the appropriateness of PRO instruments like PROMIS Fatigue (MS) 8a and PROMIS Physical Function (MS) 15a.\n\nAbstract n°3 focused on Australian MS clinical specialists' experiences and perspectives on managing family planning in people with MS. The main themes that emerged were inconsistent approaches to providing family planning and barriers in providing family planning, including a lack of local information resources, limited contemporary data on DMT safety, and various patient and professional factors.\n\nI can't answer directly about the qualitative study specifically exploring patients' experiences and understanding of Multiple Sclerosis as none of the provided abstracts directly address this query. The context only includes abstracts discussing aspects related to coping with MS (Abstract n°1), symptom identification and impact on daily life (Abstract n°2), and managing family planning in people with MS (Abstract n°3)."
