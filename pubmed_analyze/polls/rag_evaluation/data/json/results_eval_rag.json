Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",

        "response": " Based on the abstracts provided, there are three studies related to multiple sclerosis (MS). Here is a summary of each study:\n\nAbstract #1: This study investigated the use of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) versus high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (HT) for relapsing remitting MS and their effects on long-term outcome. The results showed that there was no significant difference in time to first relapse between DMF and HT, but further studies are needed to compare the long-term effects on disability and quality of life.\n\nAbstract #2: This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and remaining symptoms among people with MS and the associations with different disease-modifying therapies. The findings suggest that there were no significant differences in COVID-19 occurrence or remaining symptoms between those who had COVID-19, regardless of their disease-modifying therapy. However, it is important to note that people with MS are particularly susceptible to infection and that lingering symptoms may persist beyond the initial infection.\n\nAbstract #3: This study assessed the impact of sex on clinical outcomes in early-stage relapsing remitting MS. The results showed no significant differences in time-to-relapse, disability progression, or patient-reported outcomes between males and females four years after first manifestation. Therefore, there were no sex-related disparities in disease activity or patient-reported outcomes in this early-MS cohort.\n\nOverall, these studies provide valuable insights into the use of different disease-modifying therapies for MS and their impact on long-term outcomes, as well as the occurrence of COVID-19 and sex differences in clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to fully understand these complex relationships."

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and demyelination of CNS neurons. Up to now, there are many therapeutic strategies for MS but they are only being able to reduce progression of diseases and have not got any effect on repair and remyelination. Stem cell therapy is an appropriate method for regeneration but has limitations and problems. So recently, researches were used of exosomes that facilitate intercellular communication and transfer cell-to-cell biological information. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that we can used to their dysregulation in order to diseases diagnosis. The miRNAs of microvesicles obtained stem cells may change the fate of transplanted cells based on received signals of injured regions. The miRNAs existing in MSCs may be displayed the cell type and their biological activities. Current studies show also that the miRNAs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells. In the present review, firstly we discuss the role of miRNAs dysregulation in MS patients and miRNAs expression by stem cells. Finally, in this study was confirmed the relationship of microRNAs involved in MS and miRNAs expressed by stem cells and interaction between them in order to find appropriate treatment methods in future for limit to disability progression.",

Despite advances in the understanding of MS pathophysiology, effective treatments remain limited. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained attention as a potential therapeutic option due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. This review examines MS pathogenesis, emphasizing the role of immune cells, particularly T cells, in disease progression, and explores MSCs' therapeutic potential. Although preclinical studies in animal models show MSC efficacy, challenges such as donor variability, culture conditions, migratory capacity, and immunological compatibility hinder widespread clinical adoption. Strategies like genetic modification, optimized delivery methods, and advanced manufacturing are critical to overcoming these obstacles. Further research is needed to validate MSCs' clinical application in MS therapy.",

However, we can infer that miRNAs might play a role indirectly through their involvement in intercellular communication and the modulation of the immune system and neuroinflammation as mentioned in Abstract n°3. Additionally, MSCs (Mesenchymal Stem Cells) and their secretomes, including exosomes, have shown potential in MS therapy by exhibiting immunomodulatory properties and promoting neuroprotection and neuroregeneration, as discussed in Abstracts n°1 to 5. Further research is necessary to determine if miRNAs specifically contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for MS using MSCs or their secretomes."

The present study aimed to characterize demographic and clinical factors that potentially influence long-term disability progression in the cohort of Latvian MS patients. A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients. Despite the small differences regarding the first MS symptoms, the disability outcomes in the cohort of Latvian patients are similar to other regions of the world.",

Significant differences in time to reach an Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) of 3.0 and 6.0 were observed based on demographics and onset topography. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the onset with optic or supratentorial symptoms is linked to a longer time until EDSS = 3.0 is reached. Urban origin correlated with a prolonged time until EDSS = 3.0. Gender and environment showed no significant associations with the hazard of reaching an EDSS = 6.0. Cox regression analysis revealed no significant impact of relapses on the time to reach EDSS scores of 3.0 and 6.0 in our study cohort.Conclusions:Multivariate analysis identified several predictive factors for disability progression, including environment, age at onset, and disability level at DMT initiation.",

It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",

Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+CD4+T cells and a high proportion of Ag+CD8+T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.",

Objective:We performed a Mendelian randomization study (MR) to assess the causal effects of gut microbiota on MS. Methods:Independent genetic variants associated with 211 gut microbiota phenotypes were selected as instrumental variables from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) previously published by the MiBioGen study. GWAS data for MS were obtained from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) for primary analysis and the FinnGen consortium for replication and collaborative analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Results:After inverse-variance-weighted and sensitivity analysis filtering, seven gut microbiota with potential causal effects on MS were identified from the IMSGC. Only five metabolites remained significant associations with MS when combined with the FinnGen consortium, including genus Anaerofilum id.2053 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.141, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.021-1.276, p = .021), Ruminococcus2 id.11374 (OR = 1.190, 95% CI: 1.007-1.406, p = .042), Ruminococcaceae UCG003 id.11361 (OR = 0.822, 95% CI: 0.688-0.982, p = .031), Ruminiclostridium5 id.11355 (OR = 0.724, 95% CI: 0.585-0.895, p = .003), Anaerotruncus id.2054 (OR = 0.772, 95% CI: 0.634-0.940, p = .010).

Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses allow the estimation of the causal relationship between a risk factor and an outcome of interest using genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures. Here, we performed a two-sample MR to assess the causality between the gut microbiome and MS. We extracted genetic instruments from summary statistics from three large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on the gut microbiome (18,340, 8959, and 7738 subjects). The exposure data were derived from the latest GWAS on MS susceptibility (47,429 patients and 68,374 controls). We pinpointed several microbial strains whose abundance is linked with enhanced MS risk (Actinobacteriaclass,Bifidobacteriaceaefamily,Lactobacillusgenus) or protection (Prevotellaspp.,Lachnospiranaceaegenus,Negativibacillusgenus). The largest risk effect was seen forRuminococcus Torques(OR, 2.89, 95% C.I. 1.67-5,p= 1.51 × 10-4), whileAkkermansia municiphilaemerged as strongly protective (OR, 0.43, 95% C.I. 0.32-0.57,p= 1.37 × 10-8).

Abstract #4: In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the causal relationship between cortical structure and the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using a bidirectional MR design. They found that decreased surface area in specific brain regions, such as the paracentral lobule and frontal pole, were associated with an increased risk of ALS. Conversely, increased surface area in the medial orbitofrontal and middle temporal lobe was negatively associated with the risk of ALS. The findings suggest that changes in cortical structure may both contribute to and result from the development of ALS.\n3. Abstract #5: The study assessed the interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and pediatric-onset MS using a trivariate analysis. They found that a higher Mediterranean diet score was associated with reduced odds of developing MS. Additionally, higher fiber and iron intakes were also linked to a decreased risk of MS. The authors suggest that the interaction between diet and gut microbiota is relevant in MS development, as certain gut microbes abundances are associated with both a healthier diet and having MS."

Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",

        "response": " Based on the provided abstracts, there are some key differences between PRLs (Perivascular Lesions) and CVS (Choroidal Vasculopathy) in terms of their association with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nFirstly, according to Abstract 1, PRLs have larger volumes and lower myelin integrity compared to CVS-negative lesions. This indicates that PRLs may be associated with higher levels of lesion-specific pathology prior to the start of disease-modifying therapy. In contrast, there were no significant differences between CVS-positive and CVS-negative lesions in volume or myelin integrity.\n\nSecondly, Abstract 2 discusses the potential link between choroid plexus (CP) volume, glymphatic clearance, and brain structural changes in relapsing-remitting MS patients. The study found that CP volume was significantly increased in RRMS compared to healthy controls, while the DTI-ALPS index, which reflects glymphatic system function, was significantly decreased. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between CP volume and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score.\n\nFinally, Abstract 3 provides evidence that choroid plexus enlargement may lead to brain structural changes through the glymphatic impairment in MS patients. The study suggests that enlarged CP volume and decreased DTI-ALPS index may be closely related to deep gray matter atrophy and ventricular enlargement, and may serve as potential imaging markers of clinical disability.\n\nIn summary, PRLs are larger and have lower myelin integrity compared to CVS-negative lesions, while CP volume is significantly increased in RRMS and is associated with glymphatic impairment, deep gray matter atrophy, and ventricular enlargement. These findings highlight the potential role of PRLs and choroid plexus alterations in MS pathology, particularly in the early stages of the disease. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms and limitations of these findings."

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the CNS. A defining characteristic of MS is the ability of autoreactive T lymphocytes to cross the blood-brain barrier and mediate inflammation within the CNS. Previous work from our lab found the gene Enpp2 to be highly upregulated in murine encephalitogenic T cells. Enpp2 encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin-activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility. Importantly, using two mouse models of MS, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor ameliorated EAE severity, decreased the number of CNS infiltrating T and B cells, and suppressed relapses, suggesting autotaxin may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.",

Because EVs can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and move from the central nervous system to the peripheral circulation, and vice versa, recent studies have shown a substantial role for EVs in several neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a demyelinating disease where the main event is caused by T and B cells triggering an autoimmune reaction against myelin constituents. Recent research has elucidate the potential involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the pathophysiology of MS, although, to date, their potential role both as agents and therapeutic targets in MS is not fully defined. We present in this review a summary and comprehensive examination of EVs' involvement in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, exploring their potential applications as biomarkers and indicators of therapy response.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %.

This study involved 446 MS patients who had a baseline MRI, at least two measurements of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and a 1-year follow-up. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) for model development and 2) for evaluation. Three descriptors: β1, β2, and EDSS(t), were related to baseline MRI parameters using regression and classification XGBoost models. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis enhanced model transparency by identifying influential features. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of AI in predicting MS progression using the proposed patient trajectories and baseline MRI scans, outperforming classic Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) methods. In conclusion, MS trajectory descriptors are crucial; incorporating AI analysis into MRI assessments presents promising opportunities to advance predictive capabilities. SHAP analysis enhances model interpretation, revealing feature importance for clinical decisions.",
        "response": " Based on the provided context, AI and ML have shown promising results in improving the diagnosis and prediction of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) through various applications, such as analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and identifying influential features using techniques like Explainable Machine Learning and Shapley Additive Explanations. However, challenges associated with their implementation include ethical dilemmas related to accountability in case of errors and excessive reliance on healthcare personnel. AI and ML can help with early detection, accurate diagnosis, personalized patient management, and predictive modeling in MS, but they require large quantities of patient data for model development to identify the distinguishing characteristics between illness and health. Additionally, these technologies have shown value in analyzing various types of data, including demographics, genetics-based information, clinical, and radiological presentation. The integration of AI is becoming increasingly necessary for continued progress in MS diagnosis and treatment, but it must be done safely and responsibly to ensure ethics and patient welfare."

        "expected_abstract": "Background and purpose:Newly appearing lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) may evolve into chronically active, slowly expanding lesions (SELs), leading to sustained disability progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of newly appearing lesions developing into SELs, and their correlation to clinical evolution and treatment. Methods:A retrospective analysis of a fingolimod trial in primary progressive MS (PPMS; INFORMS,NCT00731692) was undertaken. Data were available from 324 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans up to 3 years after screening. New lesions at year 1 were identified with convolutional neural networks, and SELs obtained through a deformation-based method. Clinical disability was assessed annually by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression. Treated patients had lower volume and count of definite SELs (β = -0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.015; β = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions:Incident chronic active lesions are common in PPMS, and fingolimod treatment can reduce their number.",
        "found_abstract": "Slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) indicate a progressive pathological process. Whether SELs are present in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is unknown. We studied 19 children with POMS and 14 with MOGAD (median age 14.3 and 9.4 years, respectively) recruited to the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study with: (1) ≥3 research scans 12 months apart; and (2) ≥1 T2-lesions on the earliest scan. A total of 70 SELs from 16 POMS participants and 1 SEL in the MOGAD group were detected. SELs are an early feature of POMS and essentially not a feature of MOGAD. ANN NEUROL 2024.",
        "response": " 1. Abstract #1 discusses radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), which may be an early sign of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The author conducted a narrative review focusing on cortical lesions (CLs), central vein sign (CVS), and paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) in patients with RIS. Previous studies reported varying prevalence rates for these imaging findings, ranging from 20.0% to 40.0% for CLs, 87.0% to 93.0% for CVS + white matter lesions (WMLs), and 26.7% to 63.0% for PRLs. Although these imaging findings are frequent in RIS cohorts, they are not consistently taken into account in previous studies. Identifying these features could lead to earlier identification of patients likely to evolve to MS and benefit from disease-modifying therapies (DMTs).\n\n2. Abstract #2 presents a case study of a 42-year-old female patient who displayed obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms for six years. Neurological examinations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses identified several periventricular and one brainstem lesion suggestive of demyelination, increased white blood cell count, intrathecal immunoglobulin G and IgM synthesis, CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, a positive MRZ reaction, increased neopterin levels, and reduced serotonin levels in the CSF. In the absence of neurological attacks or clear evidence of MRI dissemination, the patient was diagnosed with RIS. This case study suggests that OCD symptoms may relate to reduced intrathecal serotonin levels and mild neuroinflammatory processes.\n\n3. Abstract #5 focuses on the choroid plexus (CP) in multiple sclerosis (MS). The author discusses how alterations in CP are involved in MS pathogenesis but highlights the limitations of current research. Choroid plexuses are enlarged and inflamed in relapsing-remitting (RRMS), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) stages, far beyond MS diagnosis. Increases in the choroid plexus/total intracranial volume (CP/TIV) ratio are associated with increased lesion load, higher translocator protein (TSPO) uptake, thalamic damage, and annual relapse rate and disability progression in active RRMS individuals. However, this association is less clear in progressive MS. Therefore, the author suggests that plexus volumetric assessments should primarily be applied to the early disease stages of MS.\n\nIn summary, these abstracts discuss various aspects related to multiple sclerosis, including radiologically isolated syndrome, imaging findings, and choroid plexus alterations. The studies emphasize the importance of identifying these features earlier in the disease course for proper diagnosis and treatment management."

        "query": "What were the key findings of the qualitative study exploring patients' experiences and understanding of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?",
        "expected_abstract": "Introduction:Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young adults worldwide, including in Iran, affects their whole life so common care is no longer effective. In this regard, context-based approaches should be considered for a holistic care delivery that accords with the patients' inputs. We aimed to explore patients' understanding of MS and their personal experiences of living with this disease. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 patients. These patients were selected using a purposive sampling method, and the data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings:Three main categories and nine subcategories were identified: Thunder and Lightning strike in the form of Displeasure, Social wrong beliefs, Experiences of Constraints, Interference with Life Stages and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future; Subtle Beam consisting of Extrinsic Light Radiation, Reflection of Individual Effort and Formation of a Rainbow by Resilience and Hope for a Bright Future. Conclusion:By offering multidimensional support, patients reported a shift from fear to a vibrant life. Although research often focuses on the negative aspects of MS, this study recognizes both positive and negative aspects. These findings can contribute to future interventional research. Patient or public contribution:During the explanation of research goals and consent acquisition, participants were reminded that sharing their experiences could provide valuable insights benefiting others coping with or at risk of the same disease. Additionally, during data analysis, codes extracted were reviewed and improved with active participant involvement.",
        "found_abstract": "Living with a chronic illness poses particular challenges, including maintaining current disease knowledge to optimise self-management and interaction with health professionals. People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are increasingly encouraged to participate in shared decision making. Making informed decisions is likely to rely on adequate knowledge about the condition and its associated risks. The aim of this systematic review is to explore patients' existing MS knowledge and MS risk knowledge, and how these relate to demographic and disease variables. A literature search was conducted using PsycINFO, PubMed and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies were published peer-reviewed reporting quantitative measures of MS knowledge and MS risk knowledge in adult MS patients. Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria comprising a total sample of 4,420 patients. A narrative synthesis was undertaken because studies employed various measures. Suboptimal levels of MS knowledge and MS risk knowledge were generally identified across studies. Greater self-reported adherence and a willingness to take medication were related to higher MS knowledge, while educational level was a significant predictor of both MS knowledge and MS risk knowledge. Associations with other demographic and disease-related variables were mixed for both knowledge domains. Direct comparison of results across studies were limited by methodological, sampling and contextual heterogeneity. The review's findings and implications for future research and clinical practice are considered from this perspective.",
