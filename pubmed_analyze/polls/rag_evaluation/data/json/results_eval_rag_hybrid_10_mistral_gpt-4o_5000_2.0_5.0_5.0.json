        "expected_abstract": "Background:Individual disease-modifying treatment (DMT) decisions might differ between female and male people with MS (pwMS). Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and demyelination of CNS neurons. Up to now, there are many therapeutic strategies for MS but they are only being able to reduce progression of diseases and have not got any effect on repair and remyelination. Stem cell therapy is an appropriate method for regeneration but has limitations and problems. So recently, researches were used of exosomes that facilitate intercellular communication and transfer cell-to-cell biological information. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that we can used to their dysregulation in order to diseases diagnosis. The miRNAs of microvesicles obtained stem cells may change the fate of transplanted cells based on received signals of injured regions. The miRNAs existing in MSCs may be displayed the cell type and their biological activities. Current studies show also that the miRNAs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells. In the present review, firstly we discuss the role of miRNAs dysregulation in MS patients and miRNAs expression by stem cells. Finally, in this study was confirmed the relationship of microRNAs involved in MS and miRNAs expressed by stem cells and interaction between them in order to find appropriate treatment methods in future for limit to disability progression.",

The present study aimed to characterize demographic and clinical factors that potentially influence long-term disability progression in the cohort of Latvian MS patients. A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients. Despite the small differences regarding the first MS symptoms, the disability outcomes in the cohort of Latvian patients are similar to other regions of the world.",

GWAS data for MS were obtained from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) for primary analysis and the FinnGen consortium for replication and collaborative analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy.

        "expected_abstract": "Background and objectives:Chronic inflammation may contribute to cognitive dysfunction and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the CNS. A defining characteristic of MS is the ability of autoreactive T lymphocytes to cross the blood-brain barrier and mediate inflammation within the CNS.

Enpp2 encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin-activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility. Importantly, using two mouse models of MS, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor ameliorated EAE severity, decreased the number of CNS infiltrating T and B cells, and suppressed relapses, suggesting autotaxin may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.",

Methods:A retrospective analysis of a fingolimod trial in primary progressive MS (PPMS; INFORMS,NCT00731692) was undertaken. Data were available from 324 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans up to 3 years after screening. New lesions at year 1 were identified with convolutional neural networks, and SELs obtained through a deformation-based method. Clinical disability was assessed annually by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression.

        "query": "What were the key findings of the qualitative study exploring patients' experiences and understanding of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)?",
        "expected_abstract": "Introduction:Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young adults worldwide, including in Iran, affects their whole life so common care is no longer effective. In this regard, context-based approaches should be considered for a holistic care delivery that accords with the patients' inputs. We aimed to explore patients' understanding of MS and their personal experiences of living with this disease. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 patients. These patients were selected using a purposive sampling method, and the data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings:Three main categories and nine subcategories were identified: Thunder and Lightning strike in the form of Displeasure, Social wrong beliefs, Experiences of Constraints, Interference with Life Stages and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future; Subtle Beam consisting of Extrinsic Light Radiation, Reflection of Individual Effort and Formation of a Rainbow by Resilience and Hope for a Bright Future. Conclusion:By offering multidimensional support, patients reported a shift from fear to a vibrant life. Although research often focuses on the negative aspects of MS, this study recognizes both positive and negative aspects. These findings can contribute to future interventional research. Patient or public contribution:During the explanation of research goals and consent acquisition, participants were reminded that sharing their experiences could provide valuable insights benefiting others coping with or at risk of the same disease. Additionally, during data analysis, codes extracted were reviewed and improved with active participant involvement.",

        "response": "The key findings of the qualitative study in Abstract n°1 identified three main categories and nine subcategories related to patients' understanding and experiences of living with Multiple Sclerosis. These included Thunder and Lightning strike, Subtle Beam, and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future. The study emphasized the importance of multidimensional support for patients. In Abstract n°2, the synthesis of qualitative studies on couples' experiences of coping with MS revealed themes of dance of accommodation, a sense of unity, outside of us, and evolving as a unit. Communication attunement was identified as key for maintaining cohesion in relationships. Lastly, Abstract n°3 explored the experiences and perspectives of Australian MS clinical specialists on managing family planning in pwMS, revealing inconsistent approaches and barriers to providing family planning."
