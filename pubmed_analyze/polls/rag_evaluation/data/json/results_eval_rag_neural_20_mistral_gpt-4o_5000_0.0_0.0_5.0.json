Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",

        "response": "The abstracts suggest that women and people with lower education are less likely to be currently treated with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for multiple sclerosis. Switchers, who discontinued their first DMT, were more likely to switch to high-efficacy DMTs such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, and natalizumab. The most frequent reasons for discontinuing the first DMT were disease activity despite DMT, adverse events, and patient request. Predictors for the first DMT switch included initial treatment with mild-to-moderate efficacy DMTs, initiation between 2014 and 2017, and shorter time on the first DMT."

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and demyelination of CNS neurons. Up to now, there are many therapeutic strategies for MS but they are only being able to reduce progression of diseases and have not got any effect on repair and remyelination. Stem cell therapy is an appropriate method for regeneration but has limitations and problems. So recently, researches were used of exosomes that facilitate intercellular communication and transfer cell-to-cell biological information. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that we can used to their dysregulation in order to diseases diagnosis. The miRNAs of microvesicles obtained stem cells may change the fate of transplanted cells based on received signals of injured regions. The miRNAs existing in MSCs may be displayed the cell type and their biological activities. Current studies show also that the miRNAs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells. In the present review, firstly we discuss the role of miRNAs dysregulation in MS patients and miRNAs expression by stem cells. Finally, in this study was confirmed the relationship of microRNAs involved in MS and miRNAs expressed by stem cells and interaction between them in order to find appropriate treatment methods in future for limit to disability progression.",
        "found_abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, leading to significant disability through neurodegeneration. Despite advances in the understanding of MS pathophysiology, effective treatments remain limited. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained attention as a potential therapeutic option due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. This review examines MS pathogenesis, emphasizing the role of immune cells, particularly T cells, in disease progression, and explores MSCs' therapeutic potential. Although preclinical studies in animal models show MSC efficacy, challenges such as donor variability, culture conditions, migratory capacity, and immunological compatibility hinder widespread clinical adoption. Strategies like genetic modification, optimized delivery methods, and advanced manufacturing are critical to overcoming these obstacles. Further research is needed to validate MSCs' clinical application in MS therapy.",
        "response": "The potential role of miRNAs in stem cell therapy for treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and how they contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, abstract n°2 suggests that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in immunomodulation through effects on T cells, cytokines, and CNS inflammation. miRNAs are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and have been shown to modulate immune responses. Therefore, it is plausible that miRNAs carried by MSC-EVs contribute to their therapeutic effects in MS. Further research is needed to validate this hypothesis."

A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients.

        "expected_abstract": "Objectives:B cells are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",
        "found_abstract": "Depletion of circulating B lymphocytes using anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) greatly reduces inflammatory activity in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS); it reduces progression to a lesser extent in nonrelapsing progressive MS. Mechanisms whereby anti-CD20 mAbs reduce MRI and clinical relapse activity in people with RMS are still being elucidated. Anti-CD20 agents do not fully protect from nonrelapsing disease progression, possibly due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inability to ameliorate the full extent of biology of MS progression. Anti-CD20 mAbs have a relatively favorable safety profile, at least in the short-term. Long-term safety studies are still needed.",

        "expected_abstract": "Background and objectives:Chronic inflammation may contribute to cognitive dysfunction and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",
        "found_abstract": "Background:The choroid plexus (CP), located within the ventricles of the brain and the primary producer of cerebrospinal fluid, has been shown to be enlarged in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and linked to periventricular remyelination failure. Atrophied T2-lesion volume (aT2-LV), a promising neurodegenerative imaging marker in progressive MS (PMS), reflects the volume of periventricular lesions subsumed into cerebrospinal fluid over the follow-up. Methods:In a cohort of 143 people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 53 with PMS, we used 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify CP volume (CPV) at baseline and aT2-LV over an average of 5.4 years of follow-up. Partial correlations, adjusting for age and sex, and linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between imaging measures. Results:In both cohorts, CPV was associated with aT2-LV in both the RRMS group (r = 0.329, p < 0.001) as well as the PMS group (r = 0.522, p < 0.001). In regression analyses predicting aT2-LV, ventricular volume (final adjusted R2 = 0.407, p < 0.001) explained additional variance beyond age, sex, and T2-lesion volume in the RRMS group while CPV (final adjusted R2 = 0.446, p = 0.009) was retained in the PMS group. Conclusion:Findings from this study suggest that the CP enlargement is associated with future neurodegeneration, with a particularly relevant role in PMS.",

Enpp2 encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin-activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility.

Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression.

Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression. Treated patients had lower volume and count of definite SELs (β = -0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.015; β = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.019, respectively). Conclusions:Incident chronic active lesions are common in PPMS, and fingolimod treatment can reduce their number.",
        "response": "The provided context suggests that in the context of fingolimod treatment, there is a reduction in the number of incident chronic active lesions that may evolve into slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in patients with primary progressive MS (PPMS). However, the context does not directly provide information on the evolution of newly appearing lesions into SELs specifically within the first year of treatment."

        "expected_abstract": "Introduction:Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young adults worldwide, including in Iran, affects their whole life so common care is no longer effective. In this regard, context-based approaches should be considered for a holistic care delivery that accords with the patients' inputs. We aimed to explore patients' understanding of MS and their personal experiences of living with this disease. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 patients. These patients were selected using a purposive sampling method, and the data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings:Three main categories and nine subcategories were identified: Thunder and Lightning strike in the form of Displeasure, Social wrong beliefs, Experiences of Constraints, Interference with Life Stages and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future; Subtle Beam consisting of Extrinsic Light Radiation, Reflection of Individual Effort and Formation of a Rainbow by Resilience and Hope for a Bright Future. Conclusion:By offering multidimensional support, patients reported a shift from fear to a vibrant life. Although research often focuses on the negative aspects of MS, this study recognizes both positive and negative aspects. These findings can contribute to future interventional research. Patient or public contribution:During the explanation of research goals and consent acquisition, participants were reminded that sharing their experiences could provide valuable insights benefiting others coping with or at risk of the same disease. Additionally, during data analysis, codes extracted were reviewed and improved with active participant involvement.",
        "found_abstract": "Background:Managing multiple sclerosis (MS) in people of reproductive age can be challenging as treatment decisions often need to balance efficacy, safety to reproductive health and an understanding of reproductive intentions. There has been limited examination of how family planning (FP) is approached in people with MS (pwMS) in Australia. This study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of Australian MS clinical specialists on managing FP in the context of MS. Methods:We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with nine neurologists and ten MS nurses across Australia who regularly provide care to pwMS of reproductive age. Interview topics examined current approaches to managing FP, availability of FP resources, and opportunities for improvement. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results:Two main themes emerged. First, 'inconsistent approaches in providing family planning', where neurologists and MS nurses recognised FP provision as essential but revealed differences in the content, timing and extent of FP discussions; conflicts between reproductive considerations and DMT prescriptions according to teratogenic risk; and variable implementation of interdisciplinary approaches. Second, 'barriers in providing family planning' emerged which included a lack of local information resources on FP, lack of contemporary data on safety of DMTs, and a range of patient and professional factors, including time constraints. Conclusion:MS clinical specialists saw FP as an essential part of the care of their patients and expressed a need for information and service provision consistency in order to improve FP and reproductive care to pwMS.",
        "response": "The key findings of the qualitative studies on patients' experiences and understanding of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) include inconsistent approaches in providing family planning, barriers in providing family planning, cultural tensions, and obstacles for women with MS. These themes emerged from interviews conducted with Australian MS clinical specialists, women with MS in Mashhad, and women diagnosed with MS in Southwestern Ontario, Canada."
