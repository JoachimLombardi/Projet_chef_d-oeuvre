        "expected_abstract": "Background:Individual disease-modifying treatment (DMT) decisions might differ between female and male people with MS (pwMS). Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",
        "expected_response": "The study revealed several key sex-related differences in DMT strategies for pwMS. Female patients had a lower probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity compared to male patients (hazard ratio [HR] 4.1 vs. 8.3 per annualized relapse rate [ARR]). Younger female patients were more likely to discontinue moderately effective DMTs, while older male patients had a lower likelihood of stopping treatment. Additionally, female patients were more likely to stop highly effective DMTs compared to males (HR 1.7). A significant reason for DMT discontinuation among female patients was family planning. These differences were independent of disease activity indicators such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR, or EDSS score. The findings underscore the importance of considering sex-related factors in MS treatment decisions to avoid unwarranted disparities in care."

        "query": "What is the potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in stem cell therapy for treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and how do they contribute to the development of new \n            therapeutic strategies?",
        "expected_abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and demyelination of CNS neurons. Up to now, there are many therapeutic strategies for MS but they are only being able to reduce progression of diseases and have not got any effect on repair and remyelination. Stem cell therapy is an appropriate method for regeneration but has limitations and problems. So recently, researches were used of exosomes that facilitate intercellular communication and transfer cell-to-cell biological information. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that we can used to their dysregulation in order to diseases diagnosis. The miRNAs of microvesicles obtained stem cells may change the fate of transplanted cells based on received signals of injured regions. The miRNAs existing in MSCs may be displayed the cell type and their biological activities. Current studies show also that the miRNAs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells. In the present review, firstly we discuss the role of miRNAs dysregulation in MS patients and miRNAs expression by stem cells. Finally, in this study was confirmed the relationship of microRNAs involved in MS and miRNAs expressed by stem cells and interaction between them in order to find appropriate treatment methods in future for limit to disability progression.",
        "expected_response": "The review highlights that while current treatments for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) focus on reducing disease progression, they do not promote repair or remyelination of damaged neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Stem cell therapy, although promising for regeneration, faces limitations. Recent research has shifted focus to exosomes, which facilitate intercellular communication and transfer biological information, including miRNAs. miRNAs, a class of short non-coding RNAs, can be used for disease diagnosis due to their dysregulation in MS. miRNAs in microvesicles derived from stem cells can influence the fate of transplanted cells based on signals from injured regions. Furthermore, miRNAs expressed in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may reflect the cell type and their biological functions. Studies show that miRNAs help mediate communication between stem cells and injured tissues, potentially offering insights into the interaction between miRNAs involved in MS and those expressed by stem cells. This understanding could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at limiting disability progression in MS patients by using miRNAs to enhance stem cell therapy outcomes."

        "query": "What demographic and clinical factors were found to influence long-term disability progression in Latvian Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients?",
        "expected_abstract": "There is wide variation in the time from the onset to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and some controversy regarding the clinical characteristics of the courses (phenotypes) of MS. The present study aimed to characterize demographic and clinical factors that potentially influence long-term disability progression in the cohort of Latvian MS patients. A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients. Despite the small differences regarding the first MS symptoms, the disability outcomes in the cohort of Latvian patients are similar to other regions of the world.",

It found that while gender did not significantly impact the rate of disease progression, patient age was strongly associated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at the first visit. The cohort was predominantly composed of patients from urban areas and non-smokers, with a female-to-male ratio of 2.4:1, consistent with other European studies. The most common initial symptom was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. Early clinical features of MS were found to be important predictors of long-term disability. Overall, despite slight differences in the initial symptoms, disability outcomes in the Latvian cohort were similar to those observed in other parts of the world."

        "expected_abstract": "Objectives:B cells are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",
        "expected_response": "The study investigated B-cell subsets in patients with untreated MS, anti-CD20-treated MS, and controls. It found no significant differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated MS patients, while anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Among the remaining B cells after treatment, there was a higher proportion of CD11c+ B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+ B cells were more abundant in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to peripheral blood in both controls and untreated MS patients. Interestingly, the proportion of CD11c+ B cells in the CSF was higher in controls and anti-CD20-treated patients than in untreated MS. These CD11c+ B cells displayed a capacity for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production, indicating that they are a functionally distinct and heterogeneous subset. The study also showed that CD11c+ B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, suggesting that these cells may play a unique role in MS pathogenesis, potentially contributing both to inflammation and immune regulation."

        "expected_abstract": "Background:Gut microbiota alterations in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been reported in observational studies, but whether these associations are causal is unclear. Objective:We performed a Mendelian randomization study (MR) to assess the causal effects of gut microbiota on MS. Methods:Independent genetic variants associated with 211 gut microbiota phenotypes were selected as instrumental variables from the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) previously published by the MiBioGen study. GWAS data for MS were obtained from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) for primary analysis and the FinnGen consortium for replication and collaborative analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Results:After inverse-variance-weighted and sensitivity analysis filtering, seven gut microbiota with potential causal effects on MS were identified from the IMSGC. Only five metabolites remained significant associations with MS when combined with the FinnGen consortium, including genus Anaerofilum id.2053 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.141, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.021-1.276, p = .021), Ruminococcus2 id.11374 (OR = 1.190, 95% CI: 1.007-1.406, p = .042), Ruminococcaceae UCG003 id.11361 (OR = 0.822, 95% CI: 0.688-0.982, p = .031), Ruminiclostridium5 id.11355 (OR = 0.724, 95% CI: 0.585-0.895, p = .003), Anaerotruncus id.2054 (OR = 0.772, 95% CI: 0.634-0.940, p = .010).

        "expected_abstract": "Background and objectives:Chronic inflammation may contribute to cognitive dysfunction and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) and choroid plexus (CP) enlargement have been proposed as markers of chronic inflammation in MS being associated with a more severe disease course. However, their relation with cognitive impairment and fatigue has not been fully explored yet. Here, we investigated the contribution of PRL number and volume and CP enlargement to cognitive impairment and fatigue in patients with MS. Methods:Brain 3T MRI, neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological assessment, including the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests and Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, were obtained from 129 patients with MS and 73 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). PRLs were identified on phase images of susceptibility-weighted imaging, whereas CP volume was quantified using a fully automatic method on brain three-dimensional T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI sequences. Predictors of cognitive impairment and fatigue were identified using random forest. Results:Thirty-six (27.9%) patients with MS were cognitively impaired, and 31/113 (27.4%) patients had fatigue. Fifty-nine (45.7%) patients with MS had ≥1 PRLs (median = 0, interquartile range = 0;2). Compared with HC, patients with MS showed significantly higher T2-hyperintense white matter lesion (WM) volume; lower normalized brain, thalamic, hippocampal, caudate, cortical, and WM volumes; and higher normalized CP volume (pfrom <0.001 to 0.040). The predictors of cognitive impairment (relative importance) (out-of-bag area under the curve [OOB-AUC] = 0.707) were normalized brain volume (100%), normalized caudate volume (89.1%), normalized CP volume (80.3%), normalized cortical volume (70.3%), number (67.3%) and volume (66.7%) of PRLs, and T2-hyperintense WM lesion volume (64.0%). Normalized CP volume was the only predictor of the presence of fatigue (OOB-AUC = 0.563). Discussion:Chronic inflammation, with higher number and volume of PRLs and enlarged CP, may contribute to cognitive impairment in MS in addition to gray matter atrophy. The contribution of enlarged CP in explaining fatigue supports the relevance of immune-related processes in determining this manifestation independently of disease severity. PRLs and CP enlargement may contribute to the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS, and they may represent clinically relevant therapeutic targets to limit the impact of these clinical manifestations in MS.",
        "expected_response": "The study explored the relationship between PRLs, CP enlargement, and cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS patients. Among 129 patients with MS, 27.9% were found to be cognitively impaired, and 27.4% experienced fatigue. The analysis revealed that a significant proportion of MS patients had PRLs (45.7%), with a median count of zero, indicating variability in the presence of these lesions. When compared to healthy controls, MS patients exhibited increased T2-hyperintense white matter lesion volume, decreased volumes of key brain regions (including the brain, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex), and an enlarged CP volume. Predictors of cognitive impairment included normalized brain volume, normalized caudate volume, and normalized CP volume, among others. Specifically, normalized CP volume emerged as the only predictor associated with the presence of fatigue. The findings suggest that chronic inflammation, indicated by a higher number and volume of PRLs and CP enlargement, contributes significantly to cognitive dysfunction in MS, alongside gray matter atrophy. Furthermore, the role of enlarged CP in relation to fatigue underscores the importance of immune-related processes in this symptom, independent of overall disease severity. Thus, PRLs and CP enlargement may represent important therapeutic targets for addressing cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS patients."

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the CNS. A defining characteristic of MS is the ability of autoreactive T lymphocytes to cross the blood-brain barrier and mediate inflammation within the CNS. Previous work from our lab found the gene Enpp2 to be highly upregulated in murine encephalitogenic T cells. Enpp2 encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin-activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility. Importantly, using two mouse models of MS, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor ameliorated EAE severity, decreased the number of CNS infiltrating T and B cells, and suppressed relapses, suggesting autotaxin may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.",

The study demonstrated that inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity, indicating a decrease in their ability to cause disease when transferred to other mice. Additionally, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor in two mouse models of MS not only ameliorated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) but also reduced the number of infiltrating T and B cells in the CNS and suppressed relapses. These findings suggest that autotaxin plays a crucial role in promoting inflammation and T cell migration in MS. Therefore, targeting autotaxin could be a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate disease severity and inflammation in MS patients."

        "expected_abstract": "Medical research offers potential for disease prediction, like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This neurological disorder damages nerve cell sheaths, with treatments focusing on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. Though MS lesion detection has been studied, limited attention has been paid to clinical analysis and computational risk factor prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %. Prediction: Sensitivity ranged from 76 % to 98 %, specificity from 65 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 62 % to 99 %. Segmentation: Accuracy ranged up to 96.7 %. Classification: Sensitivity ranged from 78 % to 97.34 %, specificity from 65 % to 99.32 %, and accuracy from 71 % to 97.94 %.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of newly appearing lesions developing into SELs, and their correlation to clinical evolution and treatment. Methods:A retrospective analysis of a fingolimod trial in primary progressive MS (PPMS; INFORMS,NCT00731692) was undertaken. Data were available from 324 patients with magnetic resonance imaging scans up to 3 years after screening. New lesions at year 1 were identified with convolutional neural networks, and SELs obtained through a deformation-based method. Clinical disability was assessed annually by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Nine-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Linear, logistic, and mixed-effect models were used to assess the relationship between the Jacobian expansion in new lesions and SELs, disability scores, and treatment status. Results:One hundred seventy patients had ≥1 new lesions at year 1 and had a higher lesion count at screening compared to patients with no new lesions (median = 27 vs. 22, p = 0.007). Among the new lesions (median = 2 per patient), 37% evolved into definite or possible SELs. Higher SEL volume and count were associated with EDSS worsening and confirmed disability progression.

A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from a fingolimod trial (INFORMS) involving 324 patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans over a three-year period. The findings revealed that 170 patients (approximately 52.5%) developed at least one new lesion by year one, and these patients had a higher baseline lesion count (median = 27) compared to those without new lesions (median = 22, p = 0.007). Among the newly identified lesions, 37% progressed to either definite or possible SELs. The study found that higher volumes and counts of SELs were linked to worsening disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and other clinical tests. Importantly, patients receiving treatment with fingolimod exhibited a lower volume and count of definite SELs, indicating that fingolimod treatment can effectively reduce the incidence of chronic active lesions. Specifically, the treatment group showed a significant decrease in both the volume (β = -0.04, 95% CI: -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.015) and count (β = -0.36, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.06, p = 0.019) of SELs.
