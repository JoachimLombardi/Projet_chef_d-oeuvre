        "expected_abstract": "Background:Individual disease-modifying treatment (DMT) decisions might differ between female and male people with MS (pwMS). Objective:To identify sex-related differences in DMT strategies over the past decades in a real-world setting. Methods:In this cohort study, data from the Austrian Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Registry (AMSTR), a nationwide prospectively collected registry mandatory for reimbursement, were retrospectively analyzed. Of 4840 pwMS, those with relapsing-remitting MS, aged at least 18 years, who started DMT and had at least two clinical visits, were identified. At baseline, demographics, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the prior 12 months and MRI lesion load were assessed. At follow-up, ARR, EDSS scores, and DMT were determined. Results:A total of 4224 pwMS were included into the study and had a median of 10 (IQR 5-18) clinical visits over an observation period of 3.5 (IQR 1.5-6.1) years. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that the probability of DMT escalation due to relapse activity was lower in female than male pwMS (HR 4.1 vs. 8.3 per ARR). Probability of discontinuing moderate-effective DMT was higher in female pwMS when they were younger (HR 1.03 per year), and lower in male pwMS at higher age (HR 0.92). Similarly, female pwMS were more likely to stop highly effective DMT than male pwMS (HR 1.7). Among others, the most frequent reason for DMT discontinuation was family planning in female pwMS. All sex-related effects were independent of disease activity, such as MRI lesion load, baseline ARR or EDSS. Conclusions:Real-world treatment decisions are influenced by sex-related aspects. Awareness of these associations should prevent unwarranted differences in MS care.",
        "found_abstract": "Chronic low-grade inflammation and neuronal deregulation are two components of a smoldering disease activity that drives the progression of disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Although several therapies exist to dampen the acute inflammation that drives MS relapses, therapeutic options to halt chronic disability progression are a major unmet clinical need. The development of such therapies is hindered by our limited understanding of the neuron-intrinsic determinants of resilience or vulnerability to inflammation. In this Review, we provide a neuron-centric overview of recent advances in deciphering neuronal response patterns that drive the pathology of MS. We describe the inflammatory CNS environment that initiates neurotoxicity by imposing ion imbalance, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, and by direct neuro-immune interactions, which collectively lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic dysregulation. The neuronal demise is further amplified by breakdown of neuronal transport, accumulation of cytosolic proteins and activation of cell death pathways. Continuous neuronal damage perpetuates CNS inflammation by activating surrounding glia cells and by directly exerting toxicity on neighbouring neurons. Further, we explore strategies to overcome neuronal deregulation in MS and compile a selection of neuronal actuators shown to impact neurodegeneration in preclinical studies. We conclude by discussing the therapeutic potential of targeting such neuronal actuators in MS, including some that have already been tested in interventional clinical trials.",

        "expected_abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation and demyelination of CNS neurons. Up to now, there are many therapeutic strategies for MS but they are only being able to reduce progression of diseases and have not got any effect on repair and remyelination. Stem cell therapy is an appropriate method for regeneration but has limitations and problems. So recently, researches were used of exosomes that facilitate intercellular communication and transfer cell-to-cell biological information. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that we can used to their dysregulation in order to diseases diagnosis. The miRNAs of microvesicles obtained stem cells may change the fate of transplanted cells based on received signals of injured regions. The miRNAs existing in MSCs may be displayed the cell type and their biological activities. Current studies show also that the miRNAs create communication between stem cells and tissue-injured cells. In the present review, firstly we discuss the role of miRNAs dysregulation in MS patients and miRNAs expression by stem cells. Finally, in this study was confirmed the relationship of microRNAs involved in MS and miRNAs expressed by stem cells and interaction between them in order to find appropriate treatment methods in future for limit to disability progression.",

Despite the availability of numerous disease-modifying therapies that effectively manage this condition, there is an emerging need to identify novel therapeutic targets, particularly for progressive forms of MS. Based on contemporary insights into disease pathophysiology, ongoing efforts are directed toward developing innovative treatment modalities. Primarily, monoclonal antibodies have been extensively investigated for their efficacy in influencing specific pathological pathways not yet targeted. Emerging approaches emphasizing cellular mechanisms, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy targeting immunological cells, are attracting increasing interest.

        "query": "What demographic and clinical factors were found to influence long-term disability progression in Latvian Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients?",
        "expected_abstract": "There is wide variation in the time from the onset to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and some controversy regarding the clinical characteristics of the courses (phenotypes) of MS. The present study aimed to characterize demographic and clinical factors that potentially influence long-term disability progression in the cohort of Latvian MS patients. A descriptive longitudinal incidence study was conducted using a cohort of 288 MS patients beginning in 2011 (disease duration from 1 to 51 years). Socio-demographic and clinical information from the first visit to 15/20 years was analysed in groups stratified by gender and visits at five-time points (the first visit; after a year or 2; after 5 ± 1 year; after 10 ± 2 years; after 15-20 years). Our study was dominated by patients from urban areas and non-smokers. The female/male ratio was 2.4:1; the distribution of clinical courses at the first visit was consistent with most European studies. The most common symptom at presentation in our study was optic manifestations, followed by sensory disturbances and motor deficits. In the Latvian study, gender was not a significant influencing factor on the rate of disease progression; however, patient age was statistically significantly associated with EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) value at the first visit. Early clinical features of MS are important in predicting the disability accumulation of patients. Despite the small differences regarding the first MS symptoms, the disability outcomes in the cohort of Latvian patients are similar to other regions of the world.",

Contemporary studies have reported data on factors associated with these diagnostic challenges and their frequency. Expediting diagnosis in patients with MS and reducing MS misdiagnosis in patients who do not have MS may be aided by educational efforts surrounding early MS symptoms and proper application of MS diagnostic criteria. Emerging novel MS diagnostic biomarkers may aid early and accurate diagnosis of MS in the future.",

        "expected_abstract": "Objectives:B cells are important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. It is yet unknown which subsets may be involved, but atypical B cells have been proposed as mediators of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated differences in B-cell subsets between controls and patients with untreated and anti-CD20-treated multiple sclerosis. Methods:We recruited 155 participants for an exploratory cohort comprising peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and a validation cohort comprising peripheral blood. Flow cytometry was used to characterize B-cell phenotypes and effector functions of CD11c+atypical B cells. Results:There were no differences in circulating B cells between controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. As expected, anti-CD20-treated patients had a markedly lower B-cell count. Of B cells remaining after treatment, we observed higher proportions of CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts. CD11c+B cells were expanded in cerebrospinal fluid compared to peripheral blood in controls and untreated multiple sclerosis. Surprisingly, the proportion of CD11c+cerebrospinal fluid B cells was higher in controls and after anti-CD20 therapy than in untreated multiple sclerosis. Apart from the presence of plasmablasts, the cerebrospinal fluid B-cell composition after anti-CD20 therapy resembled that of controls. CD11c+B cells demonstrated a high potential for both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine production. Interpretation:The study demonstrates that CD11c+B cells and plasmablasts are less efficiently depleted by anti-CD20 therapy, and that CD11c+B cells comprise a phenotypically and functionally distinct, albeit heterogenous, B-cell subset with the capacity of exerting both proinflammatory and regulatory functions.",

        "query": "What role does autotaxin play in the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and how might it serve as a therapeutic target?",
        "expected_abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the CNS. A defining characteristic of MS is the ability of autoreactive T lymphocytes to cross the blood-brain barrier and mediate inflammation within the CNS. Previous work from our lab found the gene Enpp2 to be highly upregulated in murine encephalitogenic T cells. Enpp2 encodes for the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein that catalyzes the production of lysophosphatidic acid and promotes transendothelial migration of T cells from the bloodstream into the lymphatic system. The present study sought to characterize autotaxin expression in T cells during CNS autoimmune disease and determine its potential therapeutic value. Myelin-activated CD4 T cells upregulated expression of autotaxin in vitro, and ex vivo analysis of CNS-infiltrating CD4 T cells showed significantly higher autotaxin expression compared with cells from healthy mice. In addition, inhibiting autotaxin in myelin-specific T cells reduced their encephalitogenicity in adoptive transfer studies and decreased in vitro cell motility. Importantly, using two mouse models of MS, treatment with an autotaxin inhibitor ameliorated EAE severity, decreased the number of CNS infiltrating T and B cells, and suppressed relapses, suggesting autotaxin may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.",

        "response": "Autotaxin is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as playing a role in the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or serving as a therapeutic target. However, abstract n°3 suggests that there are milieu factors contributing to the development of MS, and recent research indicates that the human gut microbiota may be one such factor. Autotaxin is an enzyme involved in lipid signaling and plays a role in regulating inflammation and immune responses. It has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. In MS, autotaxin levels have been found to be increased in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, autotaxin has been shown to promote inflammation and demyelination in experimental models of MS. Therefore, it is plausible that autotaxin could contribute to the pathogenesis of MS and might serve as a therapeutic target. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation."

        "expected_abstract": "Medical research offers potential for disease prediction, like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This neurological disorder damages nerve cell sheaths, with treatments focusing on symptom relief. Manual MS detection is time-consuming and error prone. Though MS lesion detection has been studied, limited attention has been paid to clinical analysis and computational risk factor prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) methods offer accurate and effective alternatives to mapping MS progression. However, there are challenges in accessing clinical data and interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing 103 papers, we recognize the trends, strengths and weaknesses of AI, ML, and statistical methods applied to MS diagnosis. AI/ML-based approaches are suggested to identify MS risk factors, select significant MS features, and improve the diagnostic accuracy, such as Rule-based Fuzzy Logic (RBFL), Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network methods (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Networks (BNs). Meanwhile, applications of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can enhance MS diagnostic accuracy. By examining established risk factors like obesity, smoking, and education, some research tackled the issue of disease progression. The performance metrics varied across different aspects of MS studies: Diagnosis: Sensitivity ranged from 60 % to 98 %, specificity from 60 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 61 % to 97 %. Prediction: Sensitivity ranged from 76 % to 98 %, specificity from 65 % to 98 %, and accuracy from 62 % to 99 %. Segmentation: Accuracy ranged up to 96.7 %. Classification: Sensitivity ranged from 78 % to 97.34 %, specificity from 65 % to 99.32 %, and accuracy from 71 % to 97.94 %. Furthermore, the literature shows that combining techniques can improve efficiency, exploiting their strengths for better overall performance.",

AI applications in MS range across investigation of disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A subset of AI, Machine learning (ML) models analyse various data sources, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genetic, and clinical data, to distinguish MS from other conditions, predict disease progression, and personalize treatment strategies. Additionally, AI models have been extensively applied to lesion segmentation, identification of biomarkers, and prediction of outcomes, disease monitoring, and management. Despite the big promises of AI solutions, model interpretability and transparency remain critical for gaining clinician and patient trust in these methods. The future of AI in MS holds potential for open data initiatives that could feed ML models and increasing generalizability, the implementation of federated learning solutions for training the models addressing data sharing issues, and generative AI approaches to address challenges in model interpretability, and transparency. In conclusion, AI presents an opportunity to advance our understanding and management of MS. AI promises to aid clinicians in MS diagnosis and prognosis improving patient outcomes and quality of life, however ensuring the interpretability and transparency of AI-generated results is going to be key for facilitating the integration of AI into clinical practice.",

In this regard, context-based approaches should be considered for a holistic care delivery that accords with the patients' inputs. We aimed to explore patients' understanding of MS and their personal experiences of living with this disease. Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. The data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 17 patients. These patients were selected using a purposive sampling method, and the data were analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach. Findings:Three main categories and nine subcategories were identified: Thunder and Lightning strike in the form of Displeasure, Social wrong beliefs, Experiences of Constraints, Interference with Life Stages and Dark Spots on the Horizon of the Future; Subtle Beam consisting of Extrinsic Light Radiation, Reflection of Individual Effort and Formation of a Rainbow by Resilience and Hope for a Bright Future. Conclusion:By offering multidimensional support, patients reported a shift from fear to a vibrant life. Although research often focuses on the negative aspects of MS, this study recognizes both positive and negative aspects. These findings can contribute to future interventional research. Patient or public contribution:During the explanation of research goals and consent acquisition, participants were reminded that sharing their experiences could provide valuable insights benefiting others coping with or at risk of the same disease.

        "found_abstract": "Purpose of review:Research in multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been predicated on clinical groupings that do not reflect the underlying biologic heterogeneity apparent within patient populations. This review explicates the various levels of explanation through which the spectrum of disease is described and investigated both above and below the clinical threshold of detection, as framed by the topographical model of MS, to help advance a cogent mechanistic framework. Recent findings:Contemporary evidence has amended the view of MS as consisting of sequential disease phases in favor of a spectrum of disease with an admixture of interdependent and dynamic pathobiological axes driving tissue injury and progression. Recent studies have shown the presence of acute and compartmentalized inflammation and mechanisms of neurodegeneration beginning early and evolving throughout the disease continuum. Still, the gap between the understanding of immunopathologic processes in MS and the tools used to measure relevant molecular, laboratory, radiologic, and clinical metrics needs attention to enable better prognostication of disease and monitoring for changes along specific pathologic axes and variable treatment outcomes. Summary:Aligning on a consistently-applied mechanistic framework at distinct levels of explanation will enable greater precision across bench and clinical research, and inform discourse on drivers of disability progression and delivery of care for individuals with MS.",
