    """
    Evaluate the relevance of a generated response to a query based on retrieved information.

    This function takes a query, a generated response, retrieval data, and the model used for
    evaluation. It scores the generated answer's relevance to the query on a scale from 1 to 5,
    with a higher score indicating greater relevance and consistency with the retrieval. The function
    also provides a reason for the score, especially if the generated answer contradicts the retrieval.

    Scoring Guidelines:
    - 5: Ideal, the generated answer includes all necessary information and is consistent with the retrieval.
    - 4: Mostly relevant, though it may be slightly too narrow or broad, maintaining consistency with the retrieval.
    - 3: Somewhat relevant, partly helpful but might be difficult to read or contain irrelevant content, yet consistent.
    - 2: Barely relevant, contains contradictions with the retrieval.
    - 1: Completely irrelevant and contradictory to the retrieval.

    Parameters:
    query (str): The query string provided for evaluation.
    response (str): The generated response that needs to be evaluated.
    retrieval (str): The retrieval content against which the response is evaluated.
    model (str): The model used to evaluate the response.

    template = """Your task is to score the relevance between a generated answer and the query based on the retrieval in the range between 1 and 5, and please also provide the scoring reason.  
    Your primary focus should be on determining whether the generated answer contains sufficient information to address the given query according to the retrieval.    
    If the generated answer fails to provide enough relevant information or contains excessive extraneous information, then you should reduce the score accordingly.  
    If the generated answer contradicts the retrieval, it will receive a low score of 1-2.   
    For example, for query "Is the sky blue?", the retrieval is "the sky is blue." and the generated answer is "No, the sky is not blue.".   
    In this example, the generated answer contradicts the retrieval by stating that the sky is not blue, when in fact it is blue.   
    This inconsistency would result in a low score of 1-2, and the reason for the low score would reflect the contradiction between the generated answer and the retrieval.  
    Please provide a clear reason for the low score, explaining how the generated answer contradicts the retrieval.  
    Labeling standards are as following:  
    5 - ideal, should include all information to answer the query comparing to the retrievalï¼ and the generated answer is consistent with the retrieval  
    4 - mostly relevant, although it might be a little too narrow or too broad comparing to the retrieval, and the generated answer is consistent with the retrieval  
    3 - somewhat relevant, might be partly helpful but might be hard to read or contain other irrelevant content comparing to the retrieval, and the generated answer is consistent with the retrieval  
    2 - barely relevant, perhaps shown as a last resort comparing to the retrieval, and the generated answer contradicts with the retrieval  
    1 - completely irrelevant, should never be used for answering this query comparing to the retrieval, and the generated answer contradicts with the retrieval
