It is a viral disease caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus which remains dormant in the sensory ganglia of the cranial nerve or the dorsal root ganglia after a previous varicella infection. Varicella is commonly known as chickenpox; it occurs in children while herpes zoster occurs in adults or the elderly. It is believed that zoster occurs due to the failure of the immune defense system to control the latent replication of the virus. The incidence of herpes zoster is strongly correlated to the immune status. Individuals who maintain a high level of immunity rarely develop shingles. The infection is not benign and can present in many ways. Even after herpes zoster resolves, many patients continue to suffer from moderate to severe pain known as postherpetic neuralgia.",

HZO commonly affects older and immunocompromised patients. This disease is considered an ophthalmic emergency due to the wide range of associated ocular symptoms, including severe chronic pain and vision loss. HZO is typically a clinical diagnosis due to its classic presentation of a unilateral vesicular eruption in the dermatomes corresponding to CNV1. Timely treatment is imperative to minimize ocular morbidity in HZO, given that ocular involvement is present in 50% of affected patients.",

        "abstract": "Background:A 2-dose series of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was 97% effective against herpes zoster (HZ) in a pivotal clinical trial. Objective:To evaluate real-world effectiveness of RZV against HZ. Design:Prospective cohort study. Setting:Four health care systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Participants:Persons aged 50 years or older. Measurements:The outcome was incident HZ defined by a diagnosis with an antiviral prescription. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard of HZ in vaccinated persons compared with unvaccinated persons, with adjustment for covariates. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 minus the adjusted hazard ratio and was estimated by time since the last RZV dose and by corticosteroid use. Results:The study included nearly 2.0 million persons who contributed 7.6 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment, VE of 1 dose was 64% and VE of 2 doses was 76%. After 1 dose only, VE was 70% during the first year, 45% during the second year, 48% during the third year, and 52% after the third year. After 2 doses, VE was 79% during the first year, 75% during the second year, and 73% during the third and fourth years. Vaccine effectiveness was 65% in persons who received corticosteroids before vaccination and 77% in those who did not. Limitation:Herpes zoster could not be identified as accurately in these observational data as in the previous clinical trials. Conclusion:Two doses of RZV were highly effective, although less effective than in the previous clinical trials. Two-dose effectiveness waned very little during the 4 years of follow-up. However, 1-dose effectiveness waned substantially after 1 year, underscoring the importance of the second dose. Primary funding source:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) is a painful, cutaneous disease caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which causes varicella (chickenpox) typically during childhood. The considerable healthcare burden of HZ is relatively well documented, with approximately one in three individuals experiencing at least one episode during their lifetime, debilitating symptoms including neuropathic pain, and complications such as post-herpetic neuralgia, vision loss, and rarely, stroke, and increased severity in immunocompromised individuals. However, we are not aware of a comprehensive review of literature specifically examining the burden of HZ recurrence. Methods:We conducted a PubMed search (1 January 2003-2 February 2023) to assess available literature on the incidence, risk factors, and clinical features of HZ recurrence. Results:The incidence of HZ recurrence reported by the studies identified was wide ranging. Studies in general populations of immunocompetent or immunocompetent/immunosuppressed (mixed) populations with an initial HZ episode estimate that approximately 1.2-9.6% of individuals may experience HZ recurrence, with an incidence rate of 1.7-16.6 cases per 1000 person-years. HZ recurrence was reported in 0.0-18.2% of immunocompromised individuals with HZ, with an incidence rate of 17.0-55 cases per 1000 person-years. Incidence rates varied according to study design, follow-up, and study populations. Recognized risk factors for HZ recurrence include immunocompromised status, female sex, family history, and comorbidities such as diabetes. Other factors that may predispose individuals to recurrence include long-lasting pain after the initial HZ episode and the presence of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Discussion:Our review underlines that following an initial HZ episode, individuals remain at risk of HZ recurrence, adding to the disease burden in a population. As HZ is preventable by vaccination, national HZ vaccination recommendations should include the need for and timing of vaccination in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals who have a history of HZ.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Previous studies have reported a decreased risk of dementia with herpes zoster vaccination. Given this background, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between herpes zoster vaccination and the risk of dementia. Methods:We searched five databases until November 2023 for case-control, cross-sectional, or cohort studies investigating the association of herpes zoster vaccination and dementia. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were pooled in the meta-analysis. Meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analysis were also conducted. Results:We evaluated a total of five studies (one cross-sectional, one case-control, and four cohort studies) that included a total number of 103,615 patients who were vaccinated with herpes zoster vaccine. All the studies were of high quality, ranging from 7 to 9. Due to the high heterogeneity (I2= 100%, p < .00001) observed in our study, a random effect model was used for the analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.43), p (overall effect) = .53), indicating that herpes zoster vaccination reduces the risk of dementia. Conclusion:Herpes zoster vaccination is associated with a reduction of the risk of dementia. More epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the association.",

Herpes zoster results from reactivation of the latent VZV within a sensory nerve ganglion, often presenting decades after the initial infection. The disease typically presents as a unilateral maculopapular or vesicular rash in a single dermatomal distribution. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is defined as the viral involvement of the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal cranial nerve (V). While the diagnosis of HZO does not necessarily imply eye involvement, ocular disease occurs in about 50% of HZO cases. Ocular manifestations can include conjunctivitis, uveitis, episcleritis, keratitis, and retinitis. The condition is considered an ophthalmologic emergency due to the risk of vision loss if not quickly identified and treated early in the disease course.",

Objective:To evaluate whether there is an increased risk of HZO recurrence after RZV in patients with a history of HZO. Design, setting, and participants:This retrospective cohort study used medical and outpatient pharmacy claims data for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse. Patients with incident HZO from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021, were identified; the study period ended on March 31, 2022. The vaccinated group consisted of patients with at least 1 dose of RZV more than 90 days following the initial HZO diagnosis. The unvaccinated group consisted of patients without any record of RZV in the study period. Vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were matched using exact k:1 matching without replacement. Exposure:Recombinant zoster vaccination. Main outcomes and measures:The main outcome was the number of HZO recurrences with and without RZV exposure. Results:A total of 16 408 patients were included in the matched analysis, of whom 12 762 were unvaccinated (7806 [61.2%] female; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 68.8 [10.3] years) and 3646 were vaccinated (2268 [62.2%] female; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 67.4 [9.8] years). Within the primary risk period of 56 days after the index date (ie, the start of follow-up for the outcome), the incidence of HZO recurrence after any RZV exposure was 37.7 per 1000 person-years compared with 26.2 per 1000 person-years in the unexposed group. After controlling for race and ethnicity, inpatient stays, emergency department visits, concomitant vaccines, and eye care practitioner visits, the association between vaccination status and HZO exacerbation in the primary risk period had an adjusted hazard ratio for any RZV exposure of 1.64 (95% CI, 1.01-2.67; P = .04). Conclusions and relevance:In this study, RZV exposure was associated with a higher likelihood of HZO recurrence in patients with a history of HZO compared with no RZV exposure. These findings support consideration that patients with a history of HZO may benefit from monitoring after receiving RZV in case of HZO recurrence.",

The consequences of infection are myriad and may depend on the dermatome of involvement as well as host factors such as age, comorbidities, prior treatment or immunization, and immunologic status. Pregnancy is associated with an altered immune and hormonal status in the mother. While maternal HZ infection during pregnancy is not uncommon, the implications for both mother and child are not well established, although multiple studies of perinatal maternal HZ infection suggest no intrauterine transmission to the fetus. We review the current literature on herpes zoster infection in pregnancy, including epidemiology, diagnosis, potential immunologic sequelae, and strategies for prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster, induced by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is a unilaterally distributed vesicular rash that can cause multiple complications. VZV not only causes neurological problems, including postherpetic neuralgia and ocular zoster, but also causes inflammatory vasculopathy and increases the incidence of hemorrhagic or ischemic complications. Therefore, understanding the association between the development of herpes zoster and the subsequent occurrence of acute stroke or cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and heart failure, is of great interest. Conversely, many risk factors are involved in the development of herpes zoster. Recently, it has become clear that aging, insufficient immune function, and diseases related to lifestyle habits (for example, stroke and cardiovascular disease), can trigger the onset of herpes zoster. Preventing the onset of herpes zoster, which substantially reduces quality of life, will lead to lower medical costs for countries and extend healthy life expectancy for general populations. Thus, because herpes zoster is a vaccine-preventable disease, active vaccination is recommended for high-risk groups. This review summarizes the association between herpes zoster and cardiovascular disease and vaccination against herpes zoster as a useful disease management and prevention measure for cardiovascular disease.",

It is a viral disease caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus which remains dormant in the sensory ganglia of the cranial nerve or the dorsal root ganglia after a previous varicella infection. Varicella is commonly known as chickenpox; it occurs in children while herpes zoster occurs in adults or the elderly. It is believed that zoster occurs due to the failure of the immune defense system to control the latent replication of the virus. The incidence of herpes zoster is strongly correlated to the immune status. Individuals who maintain a high level of immunity rarely develop shingles. The infection is not benign and can present in many ways. Even after herpes zoster resolves, many patients continue to suffer from moderate to severe pain known as postherpetic neuralgia.",

        "abstract": "Background:A 2-dose series of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was 97% effective against herpes zoster (HZ) in a pivotal clinical trial. Objective:To evaluate real-world effectiveness of RZV against HZ. Design:Prospective cohort study. Setting:Four health care systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Participants:Persons aged 50 years or older. Measurements:The outcome was incident HZ defined by a diagnosis with an antiviral prescription. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard of HZ in vaccinated persons compared with unvaccinated persons, with adjustment for covariates. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 minus the adjusted hazard ratio and was estimated by time since the last RZV dose and by corticosteroid use. Results:The study included nearly 2.0 million persons who contributed 7.6 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment, VE of 1 dose was 64% and VE of 2 doses was 76%. After 1 dose only, VE was 70% during the first year, 45% during the second year, 48% during the third year, and 52% after the third year. After 2 doses, VE was 79% during the first year, 75% during the second year, and 73% during the third and fourth years. Vaccine effectiveness was 65% in persons who received corticosteroids before vaccination and 77% in those who did not. Limitation:Herpes zoster could not be identified as accurately in these observational data as in the previous clinical trials. Conclusion:Two doses of RZV were highly effective, although less effective than in the previous clinical trials. Two-dose effectiveness waned very little during the 4 years of follow-up. However, 1-dose effectiveness waned substantially after 1 year, underscoring the importance of the second dose. Primary funding source:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) is a painful, cutaneous disease caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which causes varicella (chickenpox) typically during childhood. The considerable healthcare burden of HZ is relatively well documented, with approximately one in three individuals experiencing at least one episode during their lifetime, debilitating symptoms including neuropathic pain, and complications such as post-herpetic neuralgia, vision loss, and rarely, stroke, and increased severity in immunocompromised individuals. However, we are not aware of a comprehensive review of literature specifically examining the burden of HZ recurrence. Methods:We conducted a PubMed search (1 January 2003-2 February 2023) to assess available literature on the incidence, risk factors, and clinical features of HZ recurrence. Results:The incidence of HZ recurrence reported by the studies identified was wide ranging. Studies in general populations of immunocompetent or immunocompetent/immunosuppressed (mixed) populations with an initial HZ episode estimate that approximately 1.2-9.6% of individuals may experience HZ recurrence, with an incidence rate of 1.7-16.6 cases per 1000 person-years. HZ recurrence was reported in 0.0-18.2% of immunocompromised individuals with HZ, with an incidence rate of 17.0-55 cases per 1000 person-years. Incidence rates varied according to study design, follow-up, and study populations. Recognized risk factors for HZ recurrence include immunocompromised status, female sex, family history, and comorbidities such as diabetes. Other factors that may predispose individuals to recurrence include long-lasting pain after the initial HZ episode and the presence of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Discussion:Our review underlines that following an initial HZ episode, individuals remain at risk of HZ recurrence, adding to the disease burden in a population. As HZ is preventable by vaccination, national HZ vaccination recommendations should include the need for and timing of vaccination in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals who have a history of HZ.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Previous studies have reported a decreased risk of dementia with herpes zoster vaccination. Given this background, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between herpes zoster vaccination and the risk of dementia. Methods:We searched five databases until November 2023 for case-control, cross-sectional, or cohort studies investigating the association of herpes zoster vaccination and dementia. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were pooled in the meta-analysis. Meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analysis were also conducted. Results:We evaluated a total of five studies (one cross-sectional, one case-control, and four cohort studies) that included a total number of 103,615 patients who were vaccinated with herpes zoster vaccine. All the studies were of high quality, ranging from 7 to 9. Due to the high heterogeneity (I2= 100%, p < .00001) observed in our study, a random effect model was used for the analysis. The pooled odds ratio was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.43), p (overall effect) = .53), indicating that herpes zoster vaccination reduces the risk of dementia. Conclusion:Herpes zoster vaccination is associated with a reduction of the risk of dementia. More epidemiological studies are needed to confirm the association.",

Herpes zoster results from reactivation of the latent VZV within a sensory nerve ganglion, often presenting decades after the initial infection. The disease typically presents as a unilateral maculopapular or vesicular rash in a single dermatomal distribution. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is defined as the viral involvement of the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal cranial nerve (V). While the diagnosis of HZO does not necessarily imply eye involvement, ocular disease occurs in about 50% of HZO cases. Ocular manifestations can include conjunctivitis, uveitis, episcleritis, keratitis, and retinitis. The condition is considered an ophthalmologic emergency due to the risk of vision loss if not quickly identified and treated early in the disease course.",

        "abstract": "Importance:The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is currently recommended for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years or older and immunocompromised adults aged 19 years or older and is effective in preventing herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). However, questions about the safety of RZV in patients with a history of HZO remain. Objective:To evaluate whether there is an increased risk of HZO recurrence after RZV in patients with a history of HZO. Design, setting, and participants:This retrospective cohort study used medical and outpatient pharmacy claims data for commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse. Patients with incident HZO from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021, were identified; the study period ended on March 31, 2022. The vaccinated group consisted of patients with at least 1 dose of RZV more than 90 days following the initial HZO diagnosis. The unvaccinated group consisted of patients without any record of RZV in the study period. Vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were matched using exact k:1 matching without replacement. Exposure:Recombinant zoster vaccination. Main outcomes and measures:The main outcome was the number of HZO recurrences with and without RZV exposure. Results:A total of 16 408 patients were included in the matched analysis, of whom 12 762 were unvaccinated (7806 [61.2%] female; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 68.8 [10.3] years) and 3646 were vaccinated (2268 [62.2%] female; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 67.4 [9.8] years). Within the primary risk period of 56 days after the index date (ie, the start of follow-up for the outcome), the incidence of HZO recurrence after any RZV exposure was 37.7 per 1000 person-years compared with 26.2 per 1000 person-years in the unexposed group. After controlling for race and ethnicity, inpatient stays, emergency department visits, concomitant vaccines, and eye care practitioner visits, the association between vaccination status and HZO exacerbation in the primary risk period had an adjusted hazard ratio for any RZV exposure of 1.64 (95% CI, 1.01-2.67; P = .04). Conclusions and relevance:In this study, RZV exposure was associated with a higher likelihood of HZO recurrence in patients with a history of HZO compared with no RZV exposure. These findings support consideration that patients with a history of HZO may benefit from monitoring after receiving RZV in case of HZO recurrence.",

The consequences of infection are myriad and may depend on the dermatome of involvement as well as host factors such as age, comorbidities, prior treatment or immunization, and immunologic status. Pregnancy is associated with an altered immune and hormonal status in the mother. While maternal HZ infection during pregnancy is not uncommon, the implications for both mother and child are not well established, although multiple studies of perinatal maternal HZ infection suggest no intrauterine transmission to the fetus. We review the current literature on herpes zoster infection in pregnancy, including epidemiology, diagnosis, potential immunologic sequelae, and strategies for prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster, induced by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is a unilaterally distributed vesicular rash that can cause multiple complications. VZV not only causes neurological problems, including postherpetic neuralgia and ocular zoster, but also causes inflammatory vasculopathy and increases the incidence of hemorrhagic or ischemic complications. Therefore, understanding the association between the development of herpes zoster and the subsequent occurrence of acute stroke or cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction and heart failure, is of great interest. Conversely, many risk factors are involved in the development of herpes zoster. Recently, it has become clear that aging, insufficient immune function, and diseases related to lifestyle habits (for example, stroke and cardiovascular disease), can trigger the onset of herpes zoster. Preventing the onset of herpes zoster, which substantially reduces quality of life, will lead to lower medical costs for countries and extend healthy life expectancy for general populations. Thus, because herpes zoster is a vaccine-preventable disease, active vaccination is recommended for high-risk groups. This review summarizes the association between herpes zoster and cardiovascular disease and vaccination against herpes zoster as a useful disease management and prevention measure for cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "Herpes Zoster (HZ) or shingles is the reactivation of the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), usually along a single sensory nerve, but can affect both sensory and motor cranial nerves. Major risk factors for HZ include immunosuppressed status and age older than 60 years. In the United States, the lifetime risk of HZ is approximately 30%. Worldwide, the median incidence of HZ is 4-4.5 per 1000 person-years across the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. HZ ophthalmicus, occurring in 10-20% of patients, is an ophthalmic emergency characterized by VZV reactivation along the V1branch of the trigeminal nerve. Approximately half of this patient subgroup will go on to develop ocular manifestations, requiring prompt diagnosis and management. While anterior segment complications are more common, neuro-ophthalmic manifestations are rarer and can also occur outside the context of overt HZ ophthalmicus. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations include optic neuropathy, acute retinal necrosis or progressive outer retinal necrosis, cranial neuropathy (isolated or multiple), orbitopathy, and CNS manifestations. Although typically a clinical diagnosis, diagnosis may be aided by neuroimaging and laboratory (e.g., PCR and serology) studies. Early antiviral therapy is indicated as soon as a presumptive diagnosis of VZV is made and the role of corticosteroids remains debated. Generally, there is wide variation of prognosis with neuro-ophthalmic involvement. Vaccine-mediated prevention is recommended. In this review, we summarize neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of VZV. 摘要: 带状疱疹 (Herpes Zoster, HZ) 或带状疱疹 (shingles) 是再次激活的水痘带状疱疹病毒 (VZV), 沿着单个感觉神经影响感觉神经和运动脑神经的一种神经性疾病。HZ的主要危险因素包括免疫抑制状态和年龄60岁以上的老年人。在美国, HZ的终生风险约为30%。在全球范围内, 美洲、欧亚大陆和澳大利亚的HZ发病率中位数为每年每1000人4-4.5例。发生眼内炎的几率为10-20%。HZ也是一种眼科急症, 其特征是沿三叉神经V1分支的VZV病毒激活后产生的 (病变) 。患者中约有一半会出现眼部表现, 需要及时诊断和治疗。眼前段并发症更为常见, 神经眼科较为罕见, 也可能发生眼部不受累的情况。神经眼科的临床表现包括视神经病变、急性视网膜坏死或进行性视网膜外层坏死、脑神经病变 (孤立性或多发性) 、眼眶病和中枢神经系统表现。尽管可根据典型的临床表现进行诊断, 神经影像学和实验室 (如聚合酶链式反应和血清学) 结果可提供重要的辅助性临床诊断资料。一旦待确诊VZV, 需及早的抗病毒治疗, 但目前皮质类固醇的作用仍有争议。一般来说, 神经眼科病变者的预后差异很大。建议通过疫苗进行预防。在这篇综述中, 我们总结了VZV的神经眼科表现。.",

Major risk factors for HZ are increasing age and immunosuppression. HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) is a subset of HZ with involvement of the ophthalmic division of the fifth cranial trigeminal nerve. Approximately 4-20% of patients with HZ develop HZO. Approximately 50% of patients with HZO develop ocular disease, among whom up to 25% develop chronic or recurrent disease. Common manifestations of ocular disease include conjunctivitis, keratitis, and uveitis, whereas optic neuropathy and retinitis are uncommon. Due to the potential for vision impairment, ocular involvement requires urgent ophthalmic consultation. Early recognition and timely treatment with antivirals may prevent ocular complications. HZO is preventable by vaccination against HZ. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness studies have been largely conducted for HZ with few studies assessing HZO. Both the recombinant adjuvanted vaccine (RZV) and live-attenuated vaccine (ZVL) significantly reduce the incidence of HZ and HZO in older adults. RZV is more effective than ZVL. Data on the effectiveness of vaccines for prevention of recurrent disease in patients with HZO are limited; however, vaccination is recommended. Despite recommendations to vaccinate individuals likely to benefit from an HZ vaccine, coverage for adults remains suboptimal. Barriers to vaccination include patient beliefs about HZ or HZ vaccines, and factors related to healthcare providers. In particular, the lack of a recommendation from their primary care physician is often cited by patients as a reason for remaining unvaccinated. By encouraging vaccination against HZ, physicians not only prevent HZ and HZO but also potential vision loss due to HZO.Graphical abstract available for this article.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) incidence is much higher in immunocompromised individuals than in immunocompetent individuals. HZ also occurs at a younger age and is often more severe in immunocompromised persons. Preventive strategies center around the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), which is approved for immunocompromised adults age 19 and older. Identifying those at greatest risk is critical. For those considering vaccination, evidence gaps regarding vaccine efficacy, toxicity, length of protection, and potential effects on underlying conditions may complicate shared and informed decision-making. Recent data have filled some of these gaps, with several societies issuing recommendations regarding vaccination. Remaining gaps are currently addressed by expert opinion.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. The life-time risk of developing HZ is ~ 30%. Management of HZ can be challenging due to limited efficacy of oral antivirals on pain control, and neuropathic pain that may require aggressive management. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) can cause substantial pain and occurs in up to one-quarter of patients with HZ. Up to 48,000 HZ cases are estimated to occur annually in Belgium, estimated to cost almost 7 million euros in treatment. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV,Shingrix, GSK) was approved in Europe in 2017. In 2022, the Belgian Superior Health Council recommended vaccination with RZV for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 60 years, and immunocompromised patients aged ≥ 16 years, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, in particular Janus kinase inhibitors. RZV showed high age-independent efficacy in preventing HZ infection and in clinical trials that has since been confirmed in real-world effectiveness studies. In clinical trials, protection was sustained for at least 10 years after vaccination. As of 1 November 2023, RZV is reimbursed for three immunocompromised patient groups aged ≥ 18 years: malignancy treated in the past 5 years, HIV infection, and organ or haematological stem cell transplantation or are a transplant candidate. HZ is vaccine-preventable and RZV provides a highly effective tool for HZ prevention. While reimbursement for some at-risk groups is welcomed, reimbursement currently falls well short of Superior Health Council recommendations. Adult immunisation strategies should be promoted to achieve high vaccination coverage against HZ, contributing to healthy aging in Belgium.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster remains an important global health issue and mainly occurs in aged and immunocompromised individuals with an early exposure history to Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). Although the licensed vaccine Shingrix has remarkably high efficacy, undesired reactogenicity and increasing global demand causing vaccine shortage urged the development of improved or novel VZV vaccines. In this study, we developed a novel VZV mRNA vaccine candidate (named as ZOSAL) containing sequence-optimized mRNAs encoding full-length glycoprotein E encapsulated in an ionizable lipid nanoparticle. In mice and rhesus macaques, ZOSAL demonstrated superior immunogenicity and safety in multiple aspects over Shingrix, especially in the induction of strong T-cell immunity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both ZOSAL and Shingrix could robustly activate innate immune compartments, especially Type-I IFN signalling and antigen processing/presentation. Multivariate correlation analysis further identified several early factors of innate compartments that can predict the magnitude of T-cell responses, which further increased our understanding of the mode of action of two different VZV vaccine modalities. Collectively, our data demonstrated the superiority of VZV mRNA vaccine over licensed subunit vaccine. The mRNA platform therefore holds prospects for further investigations in next-generation VZV vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:The objective of this work was to summarize the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) complications in different populations. Methods:Systematic literature review of PubMed, Embase, and Virtual Health Library records between January 1, 2002 and October 20, 2022 using search strings for HZ, complications, and frequency measurements. Results:The review included 124 studies, most conducted in the general population (n = 93) and on individuals with comorbidities (n = 41) ≥ 18 years of age. Most studies were conducted in Europe (n = 44), Asia (n = 40), and North America (n = 36). Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) was the most studied neurological complication. Variable relative PHN incidence was found in the general population (2.6-46.7%) or based on diagnosis: immunocompromised (3.9-33.8%), depression (0-50%), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (6.1-40.2%). High incidence rates were observed in hematological malignancies (HM) and solid organ malignancies (132.5 and 93.7 per 1000 person-years, respectively). Ocular complications were frequently reported with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). The relative incidence (incidence rate) of HZO in the general population was reported as 1.4-15.9% (0.31-0.35 per 1000 person-years). High relative incidence was observed in HIV (up to 10.1%) and HM (3.2-11.3%). Disseminated HZ was the most frequently reported cutaneous complication. The relative incidence of disseminated HZ was 0.3-8.2% in the general population, 0-0.5% in the immunocompetent, and 0-20.6% in patients with comorbidities. High relative incidence was reported in HM and solid organ transplant (up to 19.3% and 14.8%, respectively). Discussion:Most reported complications were neurological (n = 110), ocular (n = 48), and cutaneous (n = 38). Few studies stratified complications by age or gender (or both). Incidence appeared higher in select immunocompromised populations. Higher incidence was associated with older age in several studies; the general association with gender was unclear. Conclusions:Variable incidence of HZ complications was reported by population subgroup. Further research is required to quantitatively analyze incidence by age, gender, and location.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Patients suffering from postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) report unilateral chronic pain in one or more dermatomes after an acute herpes zoster (HZ) infection. The incidence of acute HZ ranges between three and five patients per 1000 person-years. In one out of four patients, acute HZ-related pain will transition into PHN. PHN can be very disabling for patients and reduce quality of life. Additionally, the treatment of PHN is characterized by high failure rates. The aim of this review is to give an update on the previous practical guideline published in 2011 and revised in 2015 (published in 2019) and to provide an overview of current interventional treatment options for HZ infection and PHN. Methods:The literature on the diagnosis and treatment of HZ and PHN was systematically reviewed and summarized. Results:The most important treatment for acute HZ-related pain is antiviral therapy within 72 h of symptom onset. Additional symptomatic treatment options are analgesic drugs according to the WHO pain ladder, tricyclic antidepressants (eg, nortriptyline), and antiepileptic drugs (eg, gabapentin). If pain is not sufficiently reduced, interventional treatment such as an epidural injection with local anesthetics and corticosteroids or pulsed radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are options. Treatment for PHN is preferably transdermal capsaicin, lidocaine, or oral drugs such as antidepressants or antiepileptics. Conclusions:Treatment of acute HZ-related pain especially PHN is challenging. Besides the conventional treatment for PHN, interventional management is considered a new treatment option. PRF of DRG seems to be the most promising interventional management.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:The burden of herpes zoster (HZ) is substantial and numerous chronic underlying conditions are known as predisposing risk factors for HZ onset. Thus, a comprehensive study is needed to synthesize existing evidence. This study aims to comprehensively identify these risk factors. Methods:A systematic literature search was done using MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for studies published from January 1, 2003 to January 1, 2023. A random-effects model was used to estimate pooled Odds Ratios (OR). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2statistic. For sensitivity analyses basic outlier removal, leave-one-out validation and Graphic Display of Heterogeneity (GOSH) plots with different algorithms were employed to further analyze heterogeneity patterns. Finally, a multiple meta-regression was conducted. Results:Of 6392 considered records, 80 were included in the meta-analysis. 21 different conditions were identified as potential risk factors for HZ: asthma, autoimmune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disorders, chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), depression, diabetes, digestive disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, hematological disorders, HIV, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mental health conditions, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, psoriasis, renal disorders, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and transplantation. Transplantation was associated with the highest risk of HZ (OR = 4.51 (95% CI [1.9-10.7])). Other risk factors ranged from OR = 1.17-2.87, indicating an increased risk for all underlying conditions. Heterogeneity was substantial in all provided analyses. Sensitivity analyses showed comparable results regarding the pooled effects and heterogeneity. Conclusions:This study showed an increased risk of HZ infections for all identified factors.",

        "abstract": "Background:Asthma is a common respiratory disease, which may be associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ), often a debilitating disease associated with severe pain. This is the first systematic review with the objective of summarising evidence on HZ burden in adults with asthma. Methods:A global systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted (MEDLINE and Embase, 2003-2024) on HZ burden (incidence, risk and complications) in adults (≥18 years) with asthma. Results:There were 19 studies included on HZ outcomes in adults with asthma. Pooled HZ incidence per 1000 person-years was 5.71 (95% CI 4.68-6.96) in adults aged ≥18 years (4.20 (95% CI 3.09-5.70) in those aged <60 yearsversus10.33 (95% CI 9.17-11.64) in those aged ≥60 years). The pooled rate ratio for developing HZ was 1.23 (95% CI 1.11-1.35) in those aged ≥18 years and 1.36 (95% CI 1.15-1.61) in those aged ≥50 years. The risk of HZ was higher in people with asthma using systemic corticosteroids, long-acting β-agonists plus inhaled corticosteroids and \"add-on therapy\". Asthma was also associated with an increased risk of post-herpetic neuralgia (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06-1.37) and HZ ophthalmicus (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2). Differences in study design, setting, case definitions and follow-up durations led to heterogeneity. Conclusions:This systematic literature review and meta-analysis found that adults with asthma have an increased risk of HZ, with higher risks in older age groups and in those on certain treatments, such as oral corticosteroids. HZ vaccines are available for adults, including those with comorbidities such as asthma, and can be considered as part of integrated respiratory care.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella infection within the sensory ganglia, caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The disease is classically characterized by a painful unilateral vesicular eruption. Complications of the disease include herpes zoster ophthalmicus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, acute retinal necrosis, and post-herpetic neuralgia. In this paper, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, management, and vaccination strategies of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia. Method:This paper was developed with input from specialists from Singapore's public sectors-dermatologists, family physicians, and infectious diseases specialists. Results:The diagnosis of herpes zoster is clinical and can be aided with laboratory investigations. Early initiation of antivirals, within 72 h of onset, can reduce the severity and duration of the condition and decrease the intensity of pain. In patients with a high risk of post-herpetic neuralgia, early initiation of anticonvulsants or tricyclic antidepressants can be considered. Herpes zoster is highly preventable, with the advent of the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) providing an overall vaccine efficacy of 97.2%. Procedures such as epidural blocks and subcutaneous or intracutaneous injections of local anesthetics and steroids can be considered for patients with a high risk of post-herpetic neuralgia to reduce its incidence. Conclusion:This article serves as a guideline for clinicians in the diagnosis, investigations, management, and prevention of herpes zoster. With the majority of adults in Singapore currently at risk of developing herpes zoster due to varicella immunization being only introduced in 2020, it is important for clinicians to recognize and manage herpes zoster appropriately.",

        "abstract": "Herpesviruses are medium-sized double-stranded DNA viruses. Of more than 80 herpesviruses identified, only 9 human herpesviruses have been found to cause infection in humans. These include herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), human cyto-megalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus (HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7, HHV-8). HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV can be problematic given their characteristic neurotropism which is the ability to invade via fusion of its plasma membrane and reside within neural tissue. HSV and VZV primarily infect mucocutaneous surfaces and remain latent in the dorsal root ganglia for a host's entire life. Reactivation causes either asymptomatic shedding of virus or clinical manifestation of vesicular lesions. The clinical presentation is influenced by the portal of entry, the immune status of the host, and whether the infection is primary or recurrent. Affecting 60% to 95% of adults, herpesvirus-associated infections include gingivostomatitis, orofacial and genital herpes,and primary varicella and herpes zoster. Symptomatology, treatment, and potential complications vary based on primary and recurrent infections as well as the patient's immune status.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Herpes zoster vaccination is critical in preventing herpes zoster virus infection and its associated consequences. Despite its relevance, global herpes zoster immunisation coverage remains alarmingly low. Understanding the factors that drive vaccine scepticism and acceptance is crucial for increasing immunisation rates and improving public health outcomes. Methods:This scoping review, following Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, included 18 studies examining vaccine hesitancy, acceptance, and associated factors. Meticulous data analysis revealed hesitancy's intricate dynamics across countries and demographics. Results:Studies displayed a wide range of acceptance rates (2.8%-89.02%), showcasing the complex interplay of attitudes and behaviors towards vaccination. Reasons for vaccine refusal were repeatedly identified in this setting, including worries about potential adverse effects, views of vaccine necessity, and vaccine supply constraints. Notably, individuals' patterns of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy differed among countries, vaccines, and vaccination-related factors. Conclusion:Addressing acceptance hurdles by improving accessibility, providing accurate information, and strengthening healthcare recommendations is crucial. Understanding the multifaceted factors influencing hesitancy allows for targeted interventions, elevating immunization rates and enhancing public health globally.",

        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common long-term complication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation, also known as human herpesvirus-3 (HHV-3). This reactivation of the dormant VZV is known as herpes zoster or shingles. VZV is the causative agent for the childhood condition varicella, colloquially known as chickenpox. Before the advent of vaccination in the late 1990s and early 2000s, upward of 90% of American adults would test seropositive for VZV. Although this number and the percentage of adults who go on to develop herpes zoster and PHN may decrease in the coming generations, PHN is currently a topic of clinical importance. The hallmark of PHN is a lancinating/burning pain in a unilateral dermatomal pattern that persists for three or more months after the onset of a herpes zoster (HZ) outbreak. Two universally accepted risk factors for HZ are increasing age and immunosuppression, and because HZ is a prerequisite for the development of PHN, the elderly and infirm are commonly afflicted. The most successful treatments are multi-modal, with some researchers/clinicians focusing on prevention in high-risk populations rather than cure because of the debilitating and often refractory nature of PHN in already fragile patient populations.",

        "title": "Recommendations and guidance for herpes zoster vaccination for adults in Taiwan",
        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) is a painful, vesicular, cutaneous eruption from reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), which can lead to potentially debilitating complications. The lifetime risk of HZ is estimated to be 20%-30% in the general population, with an increased risk in the elderly and immunocompromised populations. The most effective strategy to prevent HZ and its complications is by vaccination. Two types of HZ vaccines, zoster vaccine live and recombinant zoster vaccine, have been approved for use. This guidance offers recommendations and suggestions for HZ vaccination in adults, aiming to reduce the disease burden of HZ and its complications. It is intended as a guide to first-line healthcare providers, but does not supersede clinical judgement when assessing risk and providing recommendations to individuals. The Working Group on Adult Immunization Practice was appointed by the Infectious Diseases Society of Taiwan (IDST) and recommendations were drafted after a full literature review, using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The recommendations were reviewed and revised by expert review panels during a series of consensus meetings and endorsed by the IDST, Taiwan Association of Family Medicine, the Taiwanese Dermatological Association, the Taiwan Oncology Society, the Taiwan Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the Transplantation Society of Taiwan, the Taiwan AIDS Society, and the Taiwan College of Rheumatology. This guidance describes the epidemiology of HZ and provides recommendations for HZ vaccination in adults with varying levels of risk, differing history of previous VZV infection and past varicella or zoster vaccinations.",

A sequela of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is debilitating and may be persistent. Therefore, vaccination for the prevention of HZ and its sequelae is recommended for adults aged 50 years and older as well as immunocompromised adults. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a recombinant DNA vaccine (Shingrix) that is safe to use in immunocompromised individuals and an improvement on the live-attenuated vaccine approved in 2006.

        "abstract": "Background:The neurocutaneous disease caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is called herpes zoster (HZ). The virus remains in the spinal cord back root after the chickenpox disappears. Diminished immune function can reactivate VZV, causing severe neuropathic pain that can last for months or even years, leading to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which severely affects the patient's quality of life. Much literature compares various cytokine levels in the body fluids HZ and PHN patients; however, no studies comprehensively evaluate them. Methods:The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline were screened for studies on cytokine levels in body fluids of HZ and PHN patients in the English language. Healthy individuals were selected as the control group, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the case and control groups was imputed using a fixed-effects or random-effects model and expressed as a 95% confidence interval (CI). The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess article quality. Results:This meta-analysis included 13 articles with 1373 participants. Compared with the control group, the HZ group had significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-10, Hcy, and C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas the levels of CD3+ T and CD4+ T lymphocytes were reduced. Additionally, PHN patients had significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1β compared with the control group. Conclusion:This meta-analysis provides compelling evidence that CRP, Hcy, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 are associated with the genesis and development of HZ and PHN. These markers can be used to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.Furthermore, for making the results more convincing, it is necessary to harmonize sample acquisition techniques and analytical methods and also require larger, more rigorously designed studies with broader subgroups and sex/age-matched controls.",

        "abstract": "The 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations on herpes zoster vaccination for adult patients with rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases stated that these patients are at increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population. However, these recommendations lack clarity and specificity and are cautiously phrased, which might cause physicians to underestimate the importance of herpes zoster vaccination for these patients, potentially resulting in suboptimal protection. Since the formulation of the 2019 EULAR guidelines, new data on herpes zoster in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases have been published. Moreover, a recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix) has become available that can be given to these patients in a more accessible manner than the original live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax). Here, we evaluate existing evidence on risk factors for herpes zoster and the safety and efficacy of the recombinant vaccine in patients with rheumatic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases and discuss the necessity of herpes zoster vaccination for these patients.",

The lesions were extensive and involved the posterior pole and mid-periphery in both cases. Both cases demonstrated scattered areas of ellipsoid zone loss, and fluorescein angiography showed corresponding late hyperfluorescence.

A comprehensive search across seven databases was conducted up to January 31, 2024, to identify studies relevant to the occurrence of HZ following COVID-19 infection and vaccination. The meta-analysis included five studies on postinfection HZ and 13 studies on postvaccination HZ. Patients infected with COVID-19 had a 2.16-fold increased risk of HZ (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-3.76) than uninfected individuals. However, there was no significant association between COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of HZ compared to controls, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.08 (95% CI: 0.84-1.39). Furthermore, a descriptive analysis of 74 postinfection and 153 postvaccination HZ studies found no significant differences on gender or age (<50 and ≥50 years) following COVID-19 infection. Notably, 44.0% of the HZ cases postinfection appeared within the first week, with 69.5% resolving within 10 days, predominantly presenting as skin lesions. In the postvaccination group, the majority (60.1%) developed HZ after the first dose and 66.7% occurred within 1 week. Moreover, 44.6% resolved within 10 days and 50.0% within a month, primarily exhibiting skin lesions and postherpetic neuralgia. The study found that COVID-19 infection increases the risk of HZ, but the COVID-19 vaccine does not. Further study is needed to explore the association between COVID-19 and HZ.",

        "abstract": "Ramsay Hunt syndrome, also known as herpes zoster oticus or geniculate ganglion herpes zoster, is a late complication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, resulting in inflammation of the geniculate ganglion of cranial nerve VII. The syndrome is named after James Ramsay Hunt (1872-1937), an American neurologist and Army officer in World War I who described three different syndromes, the most famous of which is the second, which is discussed herein as \"Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\" Early stages of VZV infection cause fever and diffuse vesicular rash, a condition that is commonly referred to as chickenpox. After the initial infection, the virus will often remain dormant in the body. Subsequent reactivation of the virus causes a \"zoster\" or \"herpes zoster\" phenomenon. This syndrome consists of pain and a vesicular rash along the involved nerve's distribution, typically corresponding to a single dermatome. The distribution and associated symptoms depend on the nerve involved. Less than 1% of zoster cases involve the facial nerve and result in Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Although the classic triad of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and a vesicular rash, there is significant variability in clinical presentation, with some patients demonstrating facial paralysis before the rash or, sometimes, no rash at all. In the latter, the patient's chief complaints are severe ear pain and facial weakness; this variant is known as zoster sine herpete and can be very difficult to clinically distinguish from Bell's palsy. Zoster sine herpete has been reported to comprise up to 30% of Ramsay Hunt cases. If a rash is present, it may be frankly vesicular or maculopapular, and can involve the affected side of the face, scalp, palate, and tongue. Additional symptoms that may be reported include a change in taste sensation, dry eye, tearing, hyperacusis, nasal obstruction, and dysarthria. Hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo can be seen with involvement of the vestibulocochlear nerve, and hoarseness or aspiration may indicate involvement of the vagus nerve.",

Objective:The objective is to investigate whether HZ is associated with incident PD risk in a matched cohort study using data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Methods:We compared the risk of PD between individuals with incident HZ matched to up to five individuals without a history of HZ using Cox proportional hazards regression. In sensitivity analyses, we excluded early outcomes. Results:Among 198,099 individuals with HZ and 976,660 matched individuals without HZ (median age 67.0 years (interquartile range [IQR 61.4-75.7]); 94% male; median follow-up 4.2 years [IQR 1.9-6.6]), HZ was not associated with an increased risk of incident PD overall (adjusted HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-1.01) or in any sensitivity analyses.

Here we perform a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy, safety, incidence of postherpetic neuralgia of brivudine. Methods:Data of randomized controlled Trials (RCTS) were obtained from the databases of both English (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) and Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science Journal Database, and WanFang Database) literatures from inception to 12 September 2022. Meta-analyses of efficacy and safety of Brivudine for the treatment of herpes zoster for RCTS were conducted. Results:The analyses included seven RCTS (2095 patients in experimental group and 2076 patients in control group) in the treatment of HZ with brivudine. It suggested that the brivudine group was superior to the control group in terms of efficacy (p= .0002) and incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (p= .04). But the incidence of adverse reactions has no significant difference between the brivudine and the control groups (p= .22). In addition, subgroup analysis of adverse events also showed that brivudine was about the same safety as other modalities in the treatment of HZ (p> .05). Conclusions:Brivudine is effective for HZ. However, the evidence on the safety of brivudine is insufficient.",

Congenital or acquired immune system deficiencies, as well as the physiological decline in immune response occurring in the elderly, known as immune senescence, can allow VZV reactivation and, consequently, HZ. One out of 3 people develops HZ during their lifetime. Moreover, thirty percent of the affected subjects develop post-herpetic neuralgia, the most frequent complication after HZ skin rash. Patients with dermatological conditions characterized by alteration of the immune system, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, bullous diseases, and cutaneous lymphomas, are at higher risk of developing HZ and post-herpetic neuralgia, even when their disease is in remission. In the present work, we described the currently available vaccinations against HZ and provided recommendations for the vaccination against HZ in patients with dermatological diseases.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a broad impact on health services and health outcomes. During the pandemic, there were numerous reports of herpes zoster (HZ) in people with COVID-19 and in COVID-19 vaccine recipients. The aim of this review is to elucidate the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HZ. It is postulated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection produces an immunosuppressive state that favours varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. Three large cohort studies (a multinational study and studies from the USA and Spain) that excluded individuals vaccinated against HZ reported significantly increased risk of HZ following COVID-19 infection, especially in people aged ≥ 50 years. In contrast, a large study from Israel that did not consider HZ vaccination status reported no such increase. Cases of HZ following COVID-19 vaccination have been reported and may be the result of attenuated cell-mediated immunity. This phenomenon appears to vary by vaccine type. Some (but not all) large analyses have reported a significant positive relationship between receipt of mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 and development of HZ. These include analyses of health records databases in Israel and Hong Kong and of spontaneous case reports in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. Routine vaccinations, including shingles vaccine programmes, were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that missed shingles vaccinations may have resulted in 63,117 avoidable HZ cases in the USA. Now that the World Health Organization has declared an end to the COVID-19 pandemic as a health emergency and routine vaccination services have resumed, there is a need to increase awareness of HZ and HZ vaccination.Graphical abstract available for this article.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) is a sequela of the reactivation of a latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection of the sensory dorsal root ganglia and cranial nerves due to a decrease in specific T cell-mediated immunity as a result of immunosenescence, immunodeficiency diseases, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or immunosuppressive therapy. The disease burden of HZ greatly increases with age; however, younger patients with, e.g., inflammatory rheumatic diseases, also have an increased risk of HZ, which is higher under certain immunosuppressive drugs, e.g., Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or glucocorticoids. The risk of complications, e.g., postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is also increased in this patient group. Of the two vaccines licensed in Germany, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) at the Robert Koch Institute recommends the recombinant adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine for the standard vaccination of all persons ≥ 60 years and for persons ≥ 50 years with an increased HZ risk for prevention of HZ and PNH due to its better efficacy and longer duration of effectiveness. Clinical trials have demonstrated a 90-97% efficacy in preventing HZ in immune healthy adults aged ≥ 50 years, with a much higher reactogenicity in the vaccine group compared to placebo. Adequate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety have also been demonstrated in clinical trials in immunocompromised and immunosuppressed patients. An extension of the STIKO vaccination recommendation to all adults with an increased HZ risk in line with the approval would be welcome. Herpes zoster (HZ) ist eine Folge der Reaktivierung einer latenten Infektion der sensorischen Hinterstrangganglien und Hirnnerven mit dem Varizella-Zoster-Virus (VZV) bei nachlassender spezifischer T‑Zell-Immunität aufgrund von Immunseneszenz, Immunschwäche (beispielsweise infolge einer Infektion mit dem „human immunodeficiency virus“ [HIV]) oder immunsuppressiver Therapie. Die Krankheitslast steigt mit zunehmendem Alter deutlich an. Doch auch jüngere Patienten, etwa mit einer entzündlich-rheumatischen Erkrankung, haben ein erhöhtes HZ-Risiko, das unter einer Therapie mit bestimmten immunsuppressiven Medikamenten weiter ansteigt, beispielsweise unter Januskinase(JAK)-Inhibitoren oder Glukokortikoiden. Auch das Risiko für einen komplikativen Verlauf, unter anderem mit postherpetischer Neuralgie (PHN), ist in dieser Patientengruppe erhöht. Von den beiden in Deutschland zugelassenen Impfstoffen empfiehlt die Ständige Impfkommission beim Robert Koch-Institut (STIKO) zur Verhinderung von HZ und PHN aufgrund einer besseren Wirksamkeit und längeren Wirkdauer den adjuvantierten HZ-subunit-Totimpfstoff für die Standardimpfung aller Personen ab 60 Jahren und für die Indikationsimpfung aller Personen mit einem erhöhten HZ-Risiko ab 50 Jahren. In Studien betrug die Wirksamkeit dieses Impfstoffs hinsichtlich der Verhinderung eines HZ bei Immungesunden in einem Alter von ≥ 50 Jahren 90–97 %, bei deutlich erhöhter Reaktogenität in der Verumgruppe im Vergleich zu Placebo. Auch in Untersuchungen zu immungeschwächten und immunsupprimierten Patienten zeigte der Impfstoff eine ausreichende Effektivität, Immunogenität und Sicherheit. Eine Erweiterung der STIKO-Impfempfehlung auf alle erwachsenen Personen mit einem erhöhten HZ-Risiko analog zur Zulassung ist wünschenswert.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review:Trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (TG-PHN) is a neuropathic pain condition complicating herpes zoster (HZ) attributed to the trigeminal nerve. It poses significant challenges due to its persistent and debilitating nature. This review explores the clinical characteristics of TG-PHN, analyzes its pathophysiological underpinnings, and addresses existent and potential therapies. Recent findings:TG-PHN is one of the most common and complex PHN locations. It has distinguishing clinical and pathophysiological characteristics, starting with viral triggered injuries to the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and peripheral tissue and involving the ascending and descending brain modulation pathways. Current therapies include vaccines, oral and topical medications, and interventional approaches, like nerve blocks and neurostimulation. This review covers TG-PHN's clinical and physiological components, treatment options, and potential future targets for improved management. By exploring the complexities of this condition, we aim to contribute to developing more effective and targeted therapies for patients suffering from trigeminal PHN.",

        "abstract": "Stroke is a common worldwide cause of death and disability, resulting from an obstruction or reduction in blood flow to the brain. Research has demonstrated that systemic infection such as herpes zoster (HZ) / ophthalmicus herpes zoster (HZO) can potentially trigger stroke. This study includes an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiologic data on the connection between HZ/HZO infection and the risk of stroke. A meticulous search of different database yielded 905 studies. Furthermore, an additional 14 studies from a previous meta-analysis were incorporated. Eligible studies underwent rigorous screening, resulting in 18 papers. Statistical analyses, including random/fixed effects models and subgroup analyses, were conducted to assess pooled relative risk (RR) and heterogeneity. The meta-analysis consisted of 5,505,885 participants and found a statistically significant association between HZ infection and the risk of stroke (pooled RR = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.34). The HZO infection showed a significantly higher overall pooled RR of 1.71 (95% CI 1.06-2.75), indicating a strong connection with the risk of stroke. Subgroup analysis revealed that the odds ratio might play a significant role in causing heterogeneity. Time since infection emerged as a crucial factor, with heightened stroke risk in the initial year post-HZ/HZO exposure, followed by a decline after the first year. Asian/Non-Asian studies demonstrated varied results in HZ/HZO patients. Meta-analysis reveals a significant HZ/HZO-stroke link. Subgroups highlight varied risks and warrant extended Asian/non-Asian patient investigation.",

        "title": "Assessing herpes zoster vaccine efficacy in patients with diabetes: A community-based cohort study",
        "abstract": "The effectiveness of herpes zoster (HZ) vaccines in patients with diabetes over the age of 50 remains an active area of research. Utilizing a real-world database from the US community, this study spanning from 2006 to 2023, aimed to evaluate the impact of HZ vaccination on newly diagnosed diabetes patients who received an HZ vaccination within 1 year of diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were established to omit patients with immune deficiencies. The cohort consisted of 53 885 patients, with an average age of 63.5 years, including 43% females and 58% whites. After implementing 1:1 propensity score matching for age, sex, race, comorbidities, diabetes medication, and hemoglobin A1c to ensure comparability, the study population was further stratified into four groups: N1 comparing any HZ vaccination to non-HZ vaccination (53 882 matched pairs), N2 for Shingrix versus non-HZ vaccination (16 665 matched pairs), N3 for Zostavax versus non-HZ vaccination (12 058 matched pairs), and N4 for Shingrix versus Zostavax (11 721 matched pairs). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed a hazard ratio (HR) for HZ incidence post any HZ vaccination of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-1.01). Additional analyses yielded HRs of 1.12 (95% CI: 0.93-1.34) for Shingrix versus non-HZ vaccine, 1.02 (95% CI: 0.86-1.20) for Zostavax versus non-HZ vaccine, and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.87-1.29) for Shingrix versus Zostavax. Subgroup analyses across age, sex, and follow-up duration also showed no significant differences. These findings underscore the lack of a significant benefit from HZ vaccination in newly diagnosed diabetes patients aged over 50, highlighting the necessity for further prospective research.",

        "abstract": "Background:The incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) has increased in the United States concurrent with decrease in herpes simplex virus (HSV) prevalence. We hypothesized that lack of HSV-elicited cross-reactive immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) results in an increased risk of HZ. Using specimens from the placebo arm of the Shingles Prevention Study, we investigated whether persons who develop HZ are less likely to have prior HSV infection than persons who do not develop HZ, and whether HZ is less severe in persons with HSV than in HSV seronegative persons. Methods:We conducted a nested case-control (1:2) study comparing the seroprevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cases (persons with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HZ) to age-, sex-, and health-matched controls (persons without HZ). Results:Sera from 639 study participants (213 cases and 426 controls) yielded definitive HSV antibody results and were analyzed. Overall, HSV seropositivity rate was 75%. HSV seronegativity was significantly higher in HZ cases than controls (30.5% vs 22.3%; P = .024), with a 55% higher risk of HZ in HSV seronegative than HSV seropositive participants. HSV seropositivity was associated with more severe HZ (P = .021). Conclusions:Our study demonstrated that prior infection with HSV partly protects against HZ.",

As HZ epidemiology and burden are evolving, this systematic literature review aimed to update the current understanding of HZ burden and associated costs for selected Asia-Pacific locales. MEDLINE and Embase were searched for English articles of HZ studies conducted in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan. Eligible outcomes included HZ incidence and prevalence, occurrence of HZ-related complications, healthcare resource utilization, costs, and HZ-associated quality of life outcomes. This paper focused on HZ data in the general adult population (N= 90 articles). Substantial HZ-related disease and economic burden were observed in these locales, consistent with global trends. These findings reinforce the increasing burden of HZ and need for preventive strategies, which may include raising awareness and encouraging timely vaccination.",

        "abstract": "Background:The Herpes Zoster (HZ) poses a significant public health threat, leading to morbidity and occasional mortality in unvaccinated adults aged 50 and older. With over 95 % of individuals in this age group globally having prior exposure to Varicella-Zoster Virus, a substantial portion of the world's population is susceptible to developing HZ. Without vaccination, individuals reaching 85 years face a 50 % lifetime risk of HZ. Organizational and logistical barriers further hinder vaccination efforts, involving complexities in cost management, demanding vaccine storage requirements, supply limitations, distribution challenges, absence of a streamlined status collection system, and healthcare system deficiencies. Methods:A systematic review was conducted on the studies that examined the logistical and organizational barriers to HZ vaccination among frail and older adults, aligning with the PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria focus on English studies in Europe, excluding pediatric or irrelevant populations. Rayyan AI was used for data extraction, and bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. Results:After excluding 841 based on titles and abstracts, 22 publications were selected. A thorough analysis identified 4 studies meeting inclusion criteria, conducted between 2009 and 2022, unveiling several barriers on HZ vaccination: challenges with healthcare professionals, obstacles related to patients' perceptions and knowledge, difficulties in accessibility, structural issues, social dynamics. Conclusions:The study represents a comprehensive examination, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to overcome these barriers. The findings underscore the urgency of addressing these challenges to enhance vaccination rates and mitigate the public health burden associated with HZ.",

        "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) can occur through various mechanisms including radiation, medication, and viral infections such as herpes zoster. Although herpes zoster is a varicella-zoster virus infection that can affect the trigeminal nerve, it rarely causes oral complications. The author reports a rare case of herpes zoster-related ONJ, followed by a review of the relevant literature pertaining to herpes zoster-related oral complications, including ONJ. A 73-year-old woman presented with a scarred skin lesion on her left midface with an exposed alveolar bone of the left maxilla. Based on her medical records, she received a diagnosis and treatment for herpes zoster six months prior and experienced a few teeth loss in the left maxilla following a fall preceding the onset of herpes zoster. Sequestrectomy of the left maxilla was performed and ONJ was diagnosed. The operative site recovered favorably. Although unusual, several cases of localized extensive ONJ in herpes zoster-infected patients have been reported. This case illustrates the possibility of a rare occurrence of unilateral widespread osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) even in the maxilla associated with herpes zoster. The exact mechanism has not been elucidated; nevertheless, surgeons should consider the possibility of oral and dental complications, including ONJ, related to a history of herpes zoster.",

        "abstract": "Background:The burden of herpes zoster (shingles) virus and associated complications, such as post-herpetic neuralgia, is higher in older adults and has a significant impact on quality of life. The incidence of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia is increased in people living with HIV (PLWH) compared to an age-matched general population, including PLWH on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) with no detectable viremia and normal CD4 counts. PLWH - even on effective ART may- exhibit sustained immune dysfunction, as well as defects in cells involved in the response to vaccines. In the context of herpes zoster, it is therefore important to assess the immune response to varicella zoster virus vaccination in older PLWH and to determine whether it significantly differs to that of HIV-uninfected healthy adults or younger PLWH. We aim at bridging these knowledge gaps by conducting a multicentric, international, non-randomised clinical study (SHINGR'HIV) with prospective data collection after vaccination with an adjuvant recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in two distinct populations: in PLWH on long-term ART (> 10 years) over 50 years of and age/gender matched controls. Methods:We will recruit participants from two large established HIV cohorts in Switzerland and in France in addition to age-/gender-matched HIV-uninfected controls. Participants will receive two doses of RZV two months apart. In depth-evaluation of the humoral, cellular, and innate immune responses and safety profile of the RZV will be performed to address the combined effect of aging and potential immune deficiencies due to chronic HIV infection. The primary study outcome will compare the geometric mean titer (GMT) of gE-specific total IgG measured 1 month after the second dose of RZV between different age groups of PLWH and between PLWH and age-/gender-matched HIV-uninfected controls. Discussion:The SHINGR'HIV trial will provide robust data on the immunogenicity and safety profile of RZV in older PLWH to support vaccination guidelines in this population.

        "abstract": "Background:The objective of this study was to estimate the annual incidence rates of herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) among individuals aged ≥19 years and the proportion who received HZ vaccination among those aged ≥50 years. Methods:This observational cohort study was conducted with administrative claims data from HealthVerity and included insured individuals across the US. Crude and US age- and sex-standardized incidence rates of HZ and PHN were calculated from 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2022 by calendar year in persons aged ≥19 years. Outcomes were defined as ≥1ICD-10diagnosis code for HZ or PHN. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, and immunocompromised status. Among those aged ≥50 years, the proportion who received 1 or 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) or 1 dose of Zostavax was calculated. Results:Standardized annual incidence rates from 2019 to 2021 were 542 to 685 per 100 000 person-years for HZ and 35 to 38 per 100 000 person-years for PHN. Rates were highest among females, older adults, and individuals who were immunocompromised. From 1 January 2019 to 31 May 2022, 4.3% and 9.0% of persons aged ≥50 years received 1 and 2 doses of Shingrix, respectively, and 0.2% received 1 dose of Zostavax. Conclusions:In this US claims database analysis, HZ and PHN were more frequent among older adults, females, and individuals who were immunocompromised. Between 1 January 2019 and 31 May 2022, 9% of persons aged ≥50 years received 2 doses of the Shingrix vaccine. Greater efforts are needed to increase vaccine uptake against HZ, especially for those at highest risk.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ), commonly known as \"shingles,\" may contribute to cognitive decline through mechanisms such as neuroinflammation or direct neuronal injury. However, evidence on the longitudinal association between HZ and cognitive decline is conflicting and whether the risk differs by APOE ε4-carrier status has not been studied; prospective cohort studies on the association between HZ vaccination and cognitive decline are also lacking. Methods:We included 149,327 participants from three large cohorts-the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS)-to prospectively examine the association between HZ and subsequent subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Poisson regression was used to estimate the multivariable-adjusted relative risk (MVRR) of a 3-unit increment in SCD score according to years since HZ compared with participants with no history of HZ. Results:Compared with individuals with no history of HZ, the MVRR (95% CI) of a 3-unit increment in SCD score was significantly and independently higher among individuals with a history of HZ, but the duration of time since HZ when the elevated risk of SCD was statistically significant differed among the cohorts. In NHS, HZ was associated with higher long-term risk of SCD; compared with individuals with no history of HZ, the MVRR (95% CI) of a 3-unit increment in SCD score was 1.14 (1.01, 1.32) for ≥ 13 years since HZ. In NHS II, HZ was associated with higher risk of SCD in both the short-term [MVRR 1.34 (1.18, 1.53) for 1-4 years] and long-term [MVRR 1.20 (1.08, 1.34) for ≥ 13 years since HZ]. In HPFS, an elevated risk of SCD was suggested across all time points. Among the subset of participants with information on APOE ε4, there was a suggestion that the association differed by APOE ε4 carrier status, but the results were not consistent between women and men. Among the subset of women with information on HZ vaccination, there was a suggestion that the long-term risk of SCD may be greater among women who were not vaccinated against HZ. Conclusions:Data from three large independent cohorts of women and men showed that HZ was associated with higher long-term risk of SCD, and the risk may differ by APOE ε4-carrier status.",

We aimed to evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for herpes zoster in individuals receiving temozolomide for glioma. Methods:A retrospective observational study was conducted on a series of patients treated with temozolomide for glioma at a single centre between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2023. Results:131 patients were treated with temozolomide for glioma with a median age of 55 years. 4 out of 131 patients (3.1 %) developed herpes zoster during temozolomide treatment. All cases of herpes zoster occurred in patients who had lymphocyte nadirs of less than 0.7 x 109/L and were receiving corticosteroids concomitantly. The estimated herpes zoster incidence rates were 45.44 per 1000 person-years (95 % confidence interval (CI) 12.38-116.34 per 1000 person-years) in the overall study population and 224.97 per 1000 person-years (95 % CI 61.30-576.02 per 1000 person-years) in subjects who were treated with corticosteroids and had a lymphocyte nadir of less than 1.0 x 109/L. Conclusion:Use of temozolomide, particularly in conjunction with lymphopaenia or corticosteroid use, poses a risk of herpes zoster. Further research into the benefits of prophylactic antiviral measures in this population is recommended.",

Design:Retrospective, cohort study METHODS: Individuals with acute HZO seen at the Auckland District Health Board from 2006 to 2016 were studied. The primary outcome measures were the proportion who developed uveitis and time to diagnosis of uveitis following the onset of HZO. Secondary outcome measures included complications of HZO uveitis and effects of prompt antiviral (within 72 hours) on outcomes. Results:869 patients with HZO were included for analysis, of whom 413 (47.6%) developed uveitis. Median time from onset of rash to diagnosis of uveitis was 10 days (IQR 6 - 14). Of the 658 individuals examined within the first week following rash onset (days 0 through 7), 17.6% (116/658) were diagnosed with uveitis at that initial presenting examination, with an additional 24.9% (164/658) diagnosed with uveitis at a subsequent visit. Complications were higher in eyes with uveitis, including: moderate or severe vision loss, corneal scarring, neurotrophic keratitis, band keratopathy, corneal melt, elevated intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataract (all p<0.01). Prompt antiviral was associated with a lower rate of moderate vision loss among eyes with uveitis (p=0.02). Conclusions:Uveitis occurred in approximately half of individuals with HZO and was most frequently diagnosed during the second week following rash onset. Eyes with uveitis were more likely to have other ocular complications and loss of vision.",

Standard treatment includes antiviral, topical and analgesic therapies. As a complication, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) can result from acute HZ infection, particularly in older and/or immunocompromised people. This can seriously impair the quality of life of those affected and requires adequate analgesia.

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) refers to the rash appearing on dermatomes due to varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. The incidence of HZ is significantly higher in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients than in non-HSCT recipients. Although acyclovir prophylaxis is routinely administered to every allo-HSCT recipient for 1 year after transplantation, some individuals eventually develop late-onset HZ after completing prophylaxis. Little information is known about the clinical features of HZ after prophylactic antiviral treatment discontinuation, and an effective predictive model of late-onset HZ needs to be established. A total of 3366 patients who had received allo-HSCT from 2012 to 2017 were included in our study, among whom 201 developed HZ after 1 year (late-onset HZ). We designed a nested case-control study to identify potential predictors of late-onset HZ. Finally, we established a predictive model using binary logistic regression analysis. Age (p < .001), use of immunosuppressants at +1 year (p < .001), CD4-CD8 ratio at +1 year (p < .001), certain mental disorders (depression, anxiety, insomnia and adjustment disorder) (p < .001), engraftment time of neutrophils (p < .001), and CD8+cell count at +30 days (p < .001) were independent predictors of late-onset HZ. A risk grading system was established based on regression coefficients. Discrimination and calibration analysis indicated that the model had good performance. We also identified several predictive factors of the incidence of HZ-related complications. This is the first scoring system for predicting the incidence of late-onset HZ after allo-HSCT. This model can be applied to identify individuals at high risk of late-onset HZ in the early period after receiving allo-HSCT.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes Zoster is an age dependent disease and as such it represents a problem in the Italian social context, where the demographic curve is characterized by an overrepresentation of the elderly population. Vaccines against Herpes Zoster are available, safe and effective, however coverage remains sub-optimal. This study was therefore conducted to examine the variations in Herpes Zoster vaccine uptake and confidence across different regions in Italy. Methods:This study utilized a cross-sectional computer-assisted web interview (CAWI) methodology. The survey was conducted by Dynata, an online panel provider, and involved 10,000 respondents recruited in Italy between April 11 and May 29, 2022. The sample was stratified based on geographic region, gender, and age group. Data management adhered to European Union data protection regulations, and the survey covered demographics, living conditions, and vaccination against herpes zoster (HZ), following the BeSD framework. Results:The findings indicate regional disparities in herpes zoster vaccine uptake across Italy. Notably, the Islands region exhibits a particularly low vaccination rate (2.9%), highlighting the need for targeted interventions. The multivariate regression analysis showed that sociodemographic factors, limited access to healthcare services, and inadequate awareness of vaccine eligibility contribute to the lower uptake observed in this region. Conclusion:In conclusion, this research emphasizes regional disparities in herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination uptake in Italy. Demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors impact individuals' willingness to receive the vaccine. The study highlights the importance of awareness of vaccine eligibility and accessible vaccination facilities in increasing uptake rates.",

        "abstract": "In Singapore, population aging and rising life expectancy are increasing herpes zoster (HZ) burden, which may be reduced by vaccination. The present study modeled the public health impact of HZ vaccination in Singapore using ZOster ecoNomic Analysis (ZONA) model adapted with Singapore-specific key model inputs, where available. Base case analysis was conducted in adults ≥ 50 years of age (YOA), exploring three vaccination strategies (no vaccination, recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV], zoster vaccine live [ZVL]) under mass vaccination setting (30% coverage). Scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed. Out of 1.51 million adults in 2021 (base case population), 406,513 (27.0%) cases of HZ, 68,264 (4.5%) cases of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), and 54,949 (3.6%) cases of other complications were projected without vaccination. RZV was estimated to avoid 73,129 cases of HZ, 11,094 cases of PHN, and 9,205 cases of other complications over the subjects' remaining lifetime; ZVL would avoid 17,565 cases of HZ, 2,781 cases of PHN, and 1,834 cases of other complications. The number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of HZ/PHN was lower for RZV (7/41) than ZVL (26/163). Among all five age-stratified cohorts (50-59/60-64/65-69/70-79/≥80 YOA), RZV (versus no vaccination/ZVL) avoided the largest number of cases in the youngest cohort, 50-59 YOA. Results were robust under scenario and sensitivity analyses. Mass vaccination with RZV is expected to greatly reduce the public health burden of HZ among Singapore individuals ≥ 50 YOA. Findings support value assessment and decision-making regarding public health vaccination strategies for HZ prevention in Singapore.",

        "abstract": "Background:Immunisation against herpes zoster is recommended for adults aged ≥ 50 years. Two vaccines, a live attenuated (ZVL, Zostavax®) and an adjuvant recombinant subunit (HZ/su, Shingrix®), are available in Australia. Immunisation guidelines are shifting their recommendations towards HZ/su because of higher efficacy in preventing herpes zoster and associated complications. However, there are limited post-marketing data comparing the safety profiles of these vaccines. Methods:Data from SmartVax, an active surveillance system for monitoring adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) utilised by > 450 clinics throughout Australia, were analysed. Data from patients aged ≥ 50 years, who received ZVL or HZ/su, from 1 June 2021 to 31 May 2022, at clinics that utilised SmartVax were included. The proportion of records where patients who reported any, local, and systemic AEFIs after receiving ZVL or HZ/su were compared using multivariable logistic regression models. Results:Data from 10,392 immunisation records (n = 8341 ZVL; n = 2051 HZ/su) were included. The proportion of AEFIs reported was higher with HZ/su (41.9 % [any], 33.8 % [local], 25.2 % [systemic]) than with ZVL (8.7 % [any], 6.2 % [local], 3.5 % [systemic]). After controlling for demographic variables, HZ/su presented a 6-fold increase in the odds (OR 6.44; 95 %CI: 5.57-7.46) of a reported AEFI compared to ZVL. Only 59 (0.6 %) of vaccinations lead to medical attention being sought due to an AEFI. Conclusions:While rates of AEFIs was higher with HZ/su than ZVL, most AEFIs were mild and did not require medical attention. Our findings support the change in vaccine recommendations and the use of HZ/su in immunisation programs.",

Design:Retrospective cohort study. Methods:The frequency of HZO out of all herpes zoster cases was calculated using International Classification of Diseases codes for patients seen at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from January 1, 2004 to October 31, 2021. We also collected demographic and clinical data of patients with HZO identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of varicella zoster virus from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2020. Results:The frequency of HZO from 2004 to 2021 in all ages was 4.2% and ranged from 2.7% to 6.7% annually, with a consistent increase of 2.9% from 2012 to 2021. After the live zoster vaccine became available in 2008, the frequency of HZO decreased by 5.1% from 2008 to 2012 in patients aged 60 and older. Among 50 cases of PCR-verified HZO, 62% represented clinically-common ocular manifestations, mostly comprised of 13 cases of keratitis and 10 cases of anterior uveitis. Fifteen cases of acute retinal necrosis (ARN) represented the majority of uncommon HZO manifestations (38%), which were significantly more likely to occur in immunosuppressed patients (unadjusted odds ratio 4.55, 95% confidence interval 1.29-13.83). Conclusions:The overall frequency of HZO from 2004 to 2021 was 4.2% and has increased annually since 2012. Uncommon ocular manifestations of PCR-verified HZO, mostly comprised of ARN, were more likely to occur in immunosuppressed patients.",

        "abstract": "Phase III multi-country studies (ZOE-50/70) demonstrated that the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was well tolerated and prevented herpes zoster (HZ) in healthy ≥ 50-year-olds, with a vaccine efficacy (VE) > 90% across age groups. These pivotal trials did not enroll participants from mainland China where RZV is licensed, therefore similar clinical data are missing for this population. In this phase IV observer-blind study (NCT04869982) conducted between 2021 and 2023 in China, immunocompetent and medically stable ≥ 50-year-olds were randomized 1:1 to receive two RZV or placebo doses, 2 months apart. This study assessed the VE (overall, as confirmatory objective, and descriptively by age category [50-69-year-olds/≥ 70-year-olds]), reactogenicity, and safety of RZV in this Chinese population. Of the 6138 enrolled participants, 99.2% completed the study. During a mean follow-up period of 15.2 (±1.1) months, 31 HZ episodes were confirmed (RZV = 0; placebo = 31) for an incidence rate of 0.0 vs 8.2 per 1000 person-years and an overall VE of 100% (89.82-100). The descriptive VE was 100% (85.29-100) for 50-69-year-olds and 100% (60.90-100) for ≥ 70-year-olds. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were more frequent in the RZV vs the placebo group (median duration: 1-3 days for both groups). Pain and fatigue were the most frequent local and general AEs (RZV: 72.1% and 43.4%; placebo: 9.2% and 5.3%). The frequencies of unsolicited AEs, serious AEs, potential immune-mediated diseases, and deaths were similar between both groups. RZV is well tolerated and efficacious in preventing HZ in Chinese ≥ 50-year-olds, consistent with efficacy studies including worldwide populations with similar age and medical characteristics.",

We report a case of a young patient with poorly controlled diabetes who developed herpes zoster optic neuritis one month after the initial skin manifestation despite completing a two-week course of oral acyclovir 800 mg five times a day. He complained of a five-day history of sudden onset, painless left eye blurring of vision. His vision over the left eye was no light perception with the presence of a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundus examination of the left eye revealed a swollen optic disc. Magnetic resonance imaging showed minimal fat streakiness over the left orbit. He was treated with one week of intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day, followed by a tapering dose of oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) together with oral acyclovir 800 mg five times a day for another week. His visual acuity remained poor with a slight improvement in vision to hand motion.",

        "abstract": "The investigation's goal was to obtain further knowledge about the connection betweenHerpes Zosterinfection and dentistry therapy for the osteonecrosis of the jaws, combining the review with a case report relevant to the purpose. It is important to study this association because it is a possible additional factor to be considered in the causes of the osteonecrosis of the jaws. We limited our search to English-language papers published between 1 January 2004 and 7 June 2024 in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science that were relevant to our topic. In the search approach, the Boolean keywords \"Herpes Zoster AND osteonecros*\" were used. Results: This study analyzed 148 papers from Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus, resulting in 95 articles after removing duplicates. Of these, 49 were removed because they were off topic, and 46 were confirmed. This study includes a qualitative analysis of the final 12 articles, removing 34 articles that were off topic. The literature highlights severe oral complications fromHerpes Zosterreactivation, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis, comprehensive management, and multidisciplinary care. Treatment strategies include antiviral therapy, pain management, surgical debridement, and antibiotics. Immunocompromised individuals require vigilant monitoring and balanced immunosuppressive therapy. Further research is needed to enhance therapeutic approaches.",

        "abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been recently approved by the FDA and are widely used in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis. However, a comprehensive safety profile of JAK inhibitors in patients with atopic dermatitis has not been analysed. This study aimed to establish clinical evidence for the safety of systemic JAK inhibitors in patients with atopic dermatitis. Medline, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) were considered for search databases. Randomized controlled trials reporting the adverse events of systemic therapy in patients with atopic dermatitis were included. The risk of 11 adverse events was compared between the JAK inhibitors and placebo groups. Fourteen randomized controlled trials were analysed published between 2019 and 2022. The JAK inhibitors included in the analysis were abrocitinib (10, 30, 100 and 200 mg), baricitinib (1, 2 and 4 mg) and upadacitinib (7.5, 15 and 30 mg). The risk of herpes zoster, headache, acne, elevated blood creatinine phosphokinase and nausea was significantly increased, but the risk of serious infection, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), malignancies other than NMSC, major adverse cardiovascular event, venous thromboembolism and nasopharyngitis was not increased. This study provides comprehensive clinical evidence on the risk of various adverse events in patients with atopic dermatitis. However, since the follow-up periods of the studies analysed in this review were mostly limited to 16 weeks or less, it is recommended that comprehensive long-term observational studies be conducted to determine any potential adverse events associated with major cardiovascular events or malignancies, which typically have prolonged courses.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster (HZ) is a painful disease that mainly affects individuals whose immune system has been weakened because of increasing age (> 50 years) or certain diseases or treatments. We estimated the complete burden of HZ. Methods:This population-based register study analysed healthcare data from the VEGA and Digitalis databases of Västra Götaland Region (VGR), Sweden. The VEGA database includes all patients in VGR, covering both hospital and primary care. The Digitalis records prescribed medications. The study population included patients aged ≥ 18 years with at least one registered primary or secondary HZ diagnosis (based on International Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes) between 2005 and 2021. Incidence rates (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were stratified by age, sex and diagnosis/analgesic prescription. Results:Overall HZ incidence increased from 2.5 (95% CI 2.4-2.6) in 2005 to 4.2 (95% CI 4.1-4.3) in 2021. The increase in incidence was rapid from 2005 to 2013, followed by a plateauing trend. From 2014-2019, the lifetime risk of HZ, excluding recurrent cases, was 36.5% (95% CI 35.5-37.4%). Municipal differences ranged from 34.4% (95% CI 32.5-36.4%) to 43.6% (95% CI 39.9-47.4%). Recurrence rates of HZ were 8.7% and 9.1% with follow-up periods of 5.5 and 10.5 years, respectively. Reported postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) cases increased five-fold over the study period. In 2019, 19% of all HZ patients developed HZ-related neuropathic pain; 13.6% had signs of persistent pain (> 90 days; i.e. PHN). An increased occurrence of cerebral and cardiovascular disease was observed in HZ patients. Among high-risk groups the occurrence of HZ peaked among those with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Conclusion:HZ and PHN risk in Sweden is comparable to that in other European countries prior to implementing HZ national vaccination programs. Municipal differences suggest that the lifetime risk of HZ in Sweden is at least 36.5%. Clinical trial registration:NCT Number ( www. Clinicaltrials:gov ).",

        "abstract": "Background:In this study, the risk of dementia in patients with a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection was evaluated. Methods:This nationwide cohort study used data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service collected between 2006 and 2017. A total of 752,205 subjects ≥ 45 years of age not diagnosed with dementia until 2006 were included. A multivariate Cox regression model, adjusted for age, sex, and other comorbidities, was used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) for dementia based on VZV or HSV infection. The interaction effects of both viral infections were analysed. Viral infections are classified into four categories: eye, central nervous system (CNS), simple, and complicated. The hazard ratio (HR) of viral infection was analysed based on the type of dementia. Results:In multivariable analysis, both HSV and VZV infection were associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR = 1.38, 95% confidence interval, CI:1.33-1.43) and (HR = 1.41, 95% CI:1.37-1.46), respectively. Patients who experienced both HSV and VZV infections were also at an increased risk of dementia (HR = 1.57, 95% CI:1.50-1.63). The co-infection group showed the shortest time from viral infection to dementia diagnosis (4.09 ± 3.02 years). In the subgroup analysis, all types of HSV and VZV infections were associated with an increased risk of dementia compared to the non-infection group. The eye, CNS, and complicated VZV infections were associated with a significantly higher risk than simple VZV infections. There were no significant differences between the subtypes of HSV infection. Furthermore, HSV, VSV, and co-infection were associated with an increased risk of all dementia types, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). Conclusions:Individual HSV and VZV infections were associated with an increased risk of all types of dementia, including AD and VD. Patients co-infected with HSV and VZV, VZV infection in the eye, CNS, or complicated type were more vulnerable to the development of dementia.",

Over a span of two weeks, the patient endured emotional trauma and subsequently developed lesions in the area of complaint. The patient was diagnosed at a medical clinic with herpes zoster and was prescribed anti-viral medication which resulted in complete resolution. This case highlights the importance of considering herpes zoster as a differential diagnosis for nerverelated symptoms. Features of lumbar radiculopathy, meralgia paresthetica, varicella zoster and herpes zoster are discussed, as well as the defining characteristics and treatment options. Practitioners must remain vigilant in suspicion of viral infections such as herpes zoster even with lower incidence due to approved vaccines.

Case description:A 71-year-old female patient complained of blurred vision in the left eye for 1 week, which was treated with topical antiglaucomatous drugs due to elevated intraocular pressure. She denied any systemic diseases, but HZO had manifested as a rash with a crust over the right forehead skin 3 months earlier. Slit-lamp examination revealed localized corneal edema with keratin precipitates and mild anterior chamber reaction. Suspecting corneal endotheliitis, we performed aqueous tapping for detecting viral DNA, including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA, through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, but the PCR results were negative for all viruses. The endotheliitis resolved well after treatment with topical prednisolone acetate. However, the patient's blurred vision recurred in the left eye 2 months later. A dendritiform lesion on the left cornea was detected, and corneal scraping for PCR testing revealed VZV DNA. The lesion disappeared with antiviral treatment. Conclusions:Bilateral HZO is uncommon, particularly in immunocompetent patients. When in doubt, physicians should perform tests such as PCR testing to help establish a definite diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infects >95% of the population. VZV reactivation causes herpes zoster (HZ), known as shingles, primarily affecting the elderly and individuals who are immunocompromised. However, HZ can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. We analyzed the immune signature and risk profile in patients with HZ using a genome-wide association study across different UK Biobank HZ cohorts. Additionally, we conducted one of the largest HZ human leukocyte antigen association studies to date, coupled with transcriptomic analysis of pathways underlying HZ susceptibility. Our findings highlight the significance of the major histocompatibility complex locus for HZ development, identifying 5 protective and 4 risk human leukocyte antigen alleles. This demonstrates that HZ susceptibility is largely governed by variations in the major histocompatibility complex. Furthermore, functional analyses revealed the upregulation of type I interferon and adaptive immune responses. These findings provide fresh molecular insights into the pathophysiology and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses triggered by symptomatic VZV reactivation.",

Case presentation:An 82-year-old male was seen by ophthalmology for acute onset of double vision. Fourteen days before presenting, he was diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. He was suspected to have zoster polyneuropathy also involving cranial nerve IX and X given a sore throat that began prior to the characteristic trigeminal dermatomal rash. He was diagnosed with cranial nerve VI palsy secondary to herpes zoster infection. Discussion:Ophthalmic complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus are many; however, extraocular nerve palsies secondary to herpes zoster infection and zoster polyneuropathy are documented infrequently in the literature. Conclusions:Extraocular muscle palsies are a rare complication of herpes zoster infection. This case reviews the most current literature surrounding this condition and discusses the significance of polyneuropathic involvement in varicella zoster virus reactivation.",

        "abstract": "The varicella-zoster virus reactivates to cause the \"herpes zoster\" (HZ). ''Varicella-zoster virus'' (VZV) termed as ''HHV-3'' or ''human herpesvirus-3'' infection causes herpes zoster. Varicella, the primary form of the virus, is chickenpox, and the secondary form of the virus is herpes zoster also called shingles. During prior chicken pox episodes, this virus enters the body through cutaneous nerve endings and becomes dormant in the dorsal root ganglia. It sometimes affects the orofacial region and appears as unilaterally distributed burning pain, multiple, painful vesicular lesions, and ulcerations. Immunocompromised people are more likely to have disseminated zoster, which is defined as the involvement of three or more dermatomes. These are most likely to occur in elderly, immunocompromised patients, patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy, patients on immunosuppressants, and patients suffering from AIDS. This is a study of a male geriatric patient, aged 74 years, who reported unilateral pain, swelling, as well as multiple ulcerations on the left side of his face, extraorally as well as intraorally. The case was diagnosed as a herpes zoster infection involving V1 and V2 dermatome of the trigeminal nerve.",

        "abstract": "Background:There is evidence that SARS-CoV2 infection can increase the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) in the general population. However, the risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not known. Methods:The TriNetX database was utilized to conduct a retrospective cohort study in patients with IBD after SARS-CoV2 infection and patients without a SARS-CoV2 infection (IBD control cohort). The primary outcome was to evaluate the risk of HZ between the 2 cohorts. One-to-one (1:1) propensity score matching was performed for demographic parameters, HZ risk factors and IBD medications between the 2 cohorts. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results:After propensity score matching, patients with IBD with a SARS-CoV2 infection were at an increased risk for HZ (aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.53-3.04) compared with IBD control cohort in the pre-COVID-19 vaccine era. There was no difference in the risk (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.44-1.75) of a composite outcome of HZ complications (hospitalization, post-herpetic neuralgia, and neurologic complications) between the 2 cohorts. The IBD SARS-CoV2 cohort was also at an increased risk for HZ (aOR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.48-6.24) compared with IBD control cohort in the postvaccine era. However, the risk of HZ in the postvaccine era was decreased (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.27-0.76) compared with IBD SARS-CoV2 cohort in the prevaccine era. Conclusions:Our study showed that SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with an increased risk of HZ in patients with IBD.",

        "abstract": "We provide estimates for (I) annual herpes zoster (HZ) cases, (II) carbon costs related to healthcare utilization, and (III) annual carbon emissions due to HZ among ≥50 years of age (YOA) United States (US) population. We estimated the annual number of HZ cases in the US based on available incidence data and demographic data of individuals ≥50 YOA. Both the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) associated with HZ cases and the unit carbon dioxide equivalent (i.e. CO2e) costs associated with each type of HCRU in the US were estimated based on literature and studies available online. The carbon footprint associated with HZ annually among US adults ≥50 YOA was estimated by multiplying the unit carbon estimates by the HCRU. In the US population aged ≥50 YOA in 2020 (i.e. approximately 118 million), approximately 1.1 million cases of HZ occur annually assuming no vaccination. Based on 2 sources of HCRU the average kgCO2e per HZ patient ranged from 61.0 to 97.6 kgCO2e, with values by age group ranging from 40.9 kgCO2e in patients aged 50-59 to 195.9 kgCO2e in patients ≥80 YOA. The total annual HZ associated carbon ranged between 67,000 and 107,000 tons of CO2e in the US population aged ≥50 YOA. The impact of HZ on carbon footprint in the US results in considerable greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions. Assuming no vaccination, the burden of HZ is projected to rise over the coming years with the aging populations consequently worsening its impact on GHG emissions. (Figure 1).",

        "abstract": "The Herpes Zoster (HZ) vaccination has proven both safe and effective in alleviating conditions related to HZ, leading to significant cost savings in national healthcare and social systems. In Italy, it is recommended and provided free of charge to individuals aged 65 and older. To achieve broad vaccination coverage, alongside ordinary immunization campaigns, active and catch-up campaigns were implemented. This retrospective observational study aimed to observe the vaccination coverage achieved in the Romagna Local Health Authority (LHA) during the 2023 active campaign, with a secondary goal of assessing the impact of the 2022 catch-up campaign and the 2023 active campaign compared to ordinary campaigns. As of 3 July 2023, an overall vaccine uptake of 13.5% was achieved among individuals born in 1958, with variations among the four LHA centers ranging from 10.2% to 17.7%. Catch-up and active campaigns together contributed to nearly half of the achieved coverage in Center No. 1 and a quarter in Center No. 2. Notably, individuals born in 1957, not included in the Center No. 2 catch-up campaign, reached significantly lower vaccination coverage compared to other cohorts and centers. Analyzing the use of text messages for active campaigns, it was observed that cohort groups did not show substantial differences in text-message utilization for warnings. However, having relatives who had experienced HZ-related symptoms significantly reduced the reliance on text messages as warnings. These results highlighted how catch-up and active campaigns effectively increased vaccine coverage. Nevertheless, differences in uptake among different centers within the same LHA and the limited contribution of other information sources compared to text messages suggest the necessity of designing campaigns involving all available channels and stakeholders to maximize vaccine uptake.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Atopic dermatitis (AD) patients have an increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ). The relationship of dupilumab, tralokinumab, upadacitinib, and abrocitinib to HZ incidence in AD patients remains unclear. Aim:To evaluate and compare the incidence and risk of HZ among patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis treated with advanced systemic therapies. Material and methods:Systematic searches were conducted in Ovid Medline and Embase. The primary outcome was incidence of HZ in patients with moderate to severe AD receiving placebo or the aforementioned treatments. A frequentist random-effects NMA was conducted with odds ratio. Results:Our search identified 16 trials comprising 10,689 patients. Upadacitinib was associated with a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of HZ compared to placebo (OR = 2.55 [1.09, 5.95] and (OR = 4.29 [1.89, 9.74], respectively) and compared to various dupilumab doses (OR = 4.48 [1.29, 15.57], 3.61 [1.28, 10.18] and 7.54 [2.21, 25.68], 6.09 [2.24, 16.52], respectively). Upadacitinib 30 mg was associated with a higher incidence of HZ when compared to upadacitinib 15 mg (OR = 1.68 [1.19, 2.38]). Abrocitinib 200 mg was associated with a higher increase in HZ compared to placebo (OR = 3.34 [1.34, 8.31]). According to SUCRA ranks, both JAK-1 inhibitors had a higher cumulative incidence of HZ compared to dupilumab. Conclusions:JAK-1 inhibitors are associated with a significantly higher incidence of HZ compared to dupilumab and placebo. Our results suggest that recombinant HZ vaccination should be highly considered for all adult patients prior to starting oral JAK-1 inhibitors.",

Observation:We report the case of a five-year-old boy of preschool age with no notable pathological history who came for consultation with a painful eruption affecting the forehead, the upper eyelid, the nose. The clinical examination showed many erythematous vesicles affecting the left hemi-face. The diagnosis of ophthalmic zoster has been retained. Minimum biological laboratory assessment is normal. The treatment was local antiseptic and systemic aciclovir with high dose for ten days. The evolution was favorable. Zoster is rare in children. The ophthalmic form is exceptional. The diagnosis is clinical and should mention some bladdery lesions grouped in bunches with a disposition which follows a metamere. It can be responsible for serious ocular complications. Conclusion:The particularity of our observation is the presence of zoster in an immunocompetent child and the ophthalmic localization, that remains exceptional in children.",

        "abstract": "Background:Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common chronic complication of herpes zoster (HZ) and results in severe refractory neuropathic pain. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of premedication with duloxetine in the prevention of PHN. Methods:The PROCESS trial is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial used a 1:1 duloxetine:control ratio. Adults 50 years or older with HZ who presented with vesicles within 72 hours were recruited. The primary outcome was the incidence of PHN at 12 weeks. PHN was defined as any pain intensity score other than 0 mm on the visual analog scale (VAS) at week 12 after the onset of the rash. The secondary outcomes were the number of participants with VAS >0 and VAS ≥3. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) principle and per-protocol (PP) principle were used for the primary outcome analysis. Results:A total of 375 participants were randomly assigned to the duloxetine group and 375 were assigned to the control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of PHN in the duloxetine group compared with the control group in the mITT analysis (86 [22.9%] of 375 vs 108 [28.8%] of 375; P = .067). PP analysis produced similar results. However, there were significant differences between the 2 groups in the number of participants with VAS >0 and VAS ≥3 (P < .05 for all comparisons). Conclusions:Although absolute prevention of PHN does not occur, this trial found that premedication with duloxetine can reduce pain associated with HZ, and therefore can have clinically relevant benefits.

        "abstract": "Background:In Japan, freeze-dried live attenuated Oka-strain varicella-zoster virus vaccine, VVL (BIKEN), is available for adults aged ≥50 years to prevent herpes zoster (HZ). Although an increase in the antibody titer and cellular immune response has been demonstrated following vaccination with VVL (BIKEN), to date, no clinical studies have shown that the vaccine decreases the incidence of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). This study investigated the incidence of HZ and PHN among adults aged ≥50 years who received a single dose of VVL (BIKEN) to prevent HZ. Methods:This retrospective cohort study investigated the incidence of HZ and PHN among adults aged ≥50 years who received a single dose of VVL (BIKEN) at a large hospital and affiliated clinics in Japan. A dispensing database and electronic medical records were used to identify vaccine recipients and cases of HZ and PHN. The end date of the follow-up period and the reason to end the follow-up were defined to avoid underestimating the incidence. The analysis was stratified according to age, sex, immunocompromising conditions, and use of immunosuppressant therapy. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using published estimates of the incidence of HZ and PHN in the unvaccinated population in Japan. Results:A total of 1175 patients were enrolled in the study. During a median follow-up period of 3.36 years, HZ was diagnosed in 27 participants (15 men [2.8%] and 12 women [1.9%]). The incidence of HZ among VVL (BIKEN) recipients was 7.67/1000 person-years. The incidence of PHN was 0.82/1000 person-years. The vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 27.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), -29.8 to 63.9%] and 73.8% [95% CI, 38.6-100%] against HZ and PHN, respectively. Conclusions:The VVL (BIKEN) had limited effectiveness at preventing HZ, but relatively good effectiveness at preventing PHN. VVL (BIKEN) might have a role as an affordable alternative.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster virus infectious facial paralysis is caused by the reactivation and replication of varicella-zoster virus, which leads to herpetic inflammatory lesions, resulting in peripheral facial paralysis associated with herpes rash in the auricle and external ear, and vestibular cochlear dysfunction. It is also known as Ramsey-Hunter syndrome (Hunt syndrome). Facial paralysis caused by herpes zoster is difficult to cure due to its easy loss of treatment and mistreatment. Cause a greater burden on the patient's body and mind. However, the treatment of Western medicine has lagged behind and there are many adverse reactions, which cannot be completely cured, and new alternatives are urgently needed. This article briefly reviews the advantages and disadvantages of modern medical treatment of Hunt syndrome. This paper expounds the unique ideas of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of Hunt syndrome from the perspectives of antiviral, antibacterial, improving blood circulation, protecting cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and nerve. This article discusses the superiority of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of Hunt syndrome from 2 aspects of Chinese medicine therapy and acupuncture therapy, and points out the feasibility of combined treatment of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. So as to provide a new treatment for Hunt syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Older adults and patients with underlying conditions such as immunocompromised (IC) populations (e.g., due to medical conditions or immunosuppressive medication) are at increased risk for herpes zoster (HZ). The first HZ recombinant vaccine for IC patients was approved in 2020. Limited evidence exists to inform decision-makers on HZ incidence in high-risk patients in Europe. This systematic literature review (SLR) assessed HZ incidence across 14 high-risk populations in the European Union/European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Methods:An SLR (Embase, Medline, 2002-2022, observational studies) was performed to identify HZ incidence (i.e., primary outcomes: rate or cumulative; secondary: relative incidence) in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma; depression; rheumatic disorders (RD); multiple sclerosis (MS); inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD); psoriasis; lupus; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); solid organ transplantation (SOT); solid organ malignancy (SOM); hematologic malignancy (HM); and stem cell transplantation (SCT). Results:Of 776 unique records screened, 59 studies were included (24 reported incidence rate per 1000 person-years; two, cumulative incidence per 1000 persons; and 33, relative incidence). The highest incidence rates were reported for SOT (12.1-78.8) and SCT (37.2-56.1); HM (2.9-32.0); RD (0.41-21.5); lupus (11.0-16.5); IC mixed population (11.3-15.5); HIV/AIDS (11.8-13.0); chronic respiratory diseases (4.7-11.4); SOM (8.8-11.0); IBD (7.0-10.8); DM (4.3-9.4); depression (7.2-7.6); MS (5.7-6.3); and psoriasis (5.3-6.1). In many high-risk populations, HZ incidence was higher for older age groups, women, and some treatments. Conclusions:The HZ incidence rate in Europe increased with age and varied across high-risk populations, with high rates for solid organ and stem cell transplants, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Most studies were retrospective with methodological differences affecting generalizability and comparability. Future studies should stratify data by IC population, age, sex, severity, medication, and study timeframe.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) is a prevalent disease characterized by a painful rash. A multi‑country study was conducted to elicit public and physician knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward HZ disease and vaccination for the assessment of local factors influencing HZ vaccine perceptions in four Asian-Pacific countries/territories One-to-one qualitative interviews were conducted in 2022, among the public (people aged ≥ 50 years, adults with parents aged ≥ 50 years, zoster vaccine live-vaccinated individuals aged ≥ 50 years in Republic of Korea, and HZ patients;n= 78) and physicians (general practitioners and specialists;n= 24). Themes surrounding KAP toward HZ and HZ vaccination were summarized using a thematic analysis. A substantial knowledge gap related to HZ was observed among the public, including its causes, long-term impacts, and the at-risk population. There was a low perceived risk of HZ and low general awareness of HZ vaccine availability, although country/territory-specific differences existed. Fear of HZ-associated pain contributed toward vaccination intent among HZ patients and adults with parents aged ≥ 50 years. HZ-naïve adults who were encouraged to receive the vaccine by others were not motivated to do so due to optimism bias. Physicians were perceived to be a reliable source of information. However, physicians did not always proactively discuss HZ vaccination due to time constraints and a perceived need to prioritize other vaccinations including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Initiatives are needed to improve public awareness of HZ and its complications, in terms of overall impact on individuals and society, and highlight the important role of physicians in recommending vaccination.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Patients with RA treated with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) are at increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ). The objective of this study was to investigate the serological immunogenicity and safety of the HZ subunit (HZ/su) vaccine in RA patients treated with JAKi, for which little is known. Methods:RA patients treated with JAKi (n = 82) at the Department of Rheumatology, Skåne University Hospital, Lund and Malmö, Sweden, and healthy controls (n = 51) received two doses of the HZ/su vaccine (Shingrix). Vaccine-specific antibody responses were analysed using indirect ELISA. Post-vaccination antibody levels were compared between patients and controls using analysis of covariance. Potential predictors for vaccine response were investigated using a multivariable linear regression analysis. Self-reported adverse events (AEs) and changes in RA disease activity were analysed. Results:Following vaccination, vaccine-specific antibody levels increased significantly in both patients and controls (P < 0.0001). A total of 80.5% of patients and 98.0% of controls achieved a ≥4-fold increase in antibody levels. Post-vaccination antibody levels were lower in patients than controls [ratio 0.44 (95% CI 0.31, 0.63)] and lower in patients receiving JAKi + methotrexate than JAKi monotherapy [ratio 0.43 (95% CI 0.24, 0.79)]. AEs, mostly mild/moderate, were common. One patient developed HZ and six patients (6.5%) had increased RA disease activity following vaccination. Conclusion:The HZ/su vaccine was serologically immunogenic in most RA patients treated with JAKi. Moreover, the vaccine had an acceptable safety profile. These results support recommendations for use of the HZ/su vaccine in this vulnerable population. Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov),NCT03886038.",

Methods:We enrolled 103 living kidney transplant recipients. Patients were divided into two groups according to their history of rituximab treatment; rituximab was administered to 50 living kidney transplant recipients. We assessed the difference in herpes zoster events between the two groups and determined the risk factors for herpes zoster using multivariate regression analysis. Results:The total dose of rituximab in each kidney transplant recipient who received rituximab therapy was 200-400 mg. The rate of herpes zoster events after transplantation in recipients who received rituximab therapy (4 of 50, 8%) was not higher than that in recipients who did not receive rituximab (9 of 53, 17%) (p = 0.238). Herpes zoster-free survival did not significantly differ between the two groups (p = 0.409). In the multivariate regression analysis, the association between varicella zoster vaccination before transplantation and herpes zoster events after transplantation was confirmed, whereas rituximab therapy was not associated with herpes zoster events. Conclusions:Low-dose rituximab therapy in kidney transplant recipients did not influence herpes zoster development after transplantation. Varicella zoster vaccination before transplantation may play an important role in preventing herpes zoster after transplantation.",

        "abstract": "The burden of herpes zoster (HZ) is anticipated to increase among the aging population of China over time. The knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the population toward HZ can help inform the design of public health strategies. As there is a paucity of KAP data in China, this cross-sectional survey therefore sought to assess KAP related to HZ from the general population, patients with HZ, and dermatologists in China. The total number of respondents from the general population, HZ patients, and dermatologists were 804, 282, and 160, respectively. Notably, some gaps in knowledge regarding the severity, transmission, and prevention of HZ were identified across all groups. For example, less than half of respondents from the general population and HZ patients understood that vaccination does not treat HZ. For dermatologists, not all were aware of adverse reactions following HZ vaccination and some had misconceptions regarding the mode of transmission of HZ. Given the link between an individual's disease knowledge to their attitudes and practices, improved understanding of HZ could underlie positive attitudes and help reinforce healthcare professionals' recommendations in the management and prevention of HZ. In particular, doctors may be well-positioned to support HZ prevention initiatives, as most of the general population and HZ patients found vaccination more acceptable if recommended by a doctor (78.9% and 81.6%, respectively). Therefore, consideration of these KAP attributes may support the development of targeted educational interventions and effective public health strategies against HZ in China.",

This study aimed to explore the risk of HZ in patients with rheumatic diseases in the perspective of IRIS. The study retrospectively reviewed the clinical courses of 20 patients with HZ and investigated the IRIS triggers such as the reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs within 3 months and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination within 4 weeks prior to HZ development. Disease activity of the underlying rheumatic disease at HZ onset was evaluated using the physician's global assessment. Thirteen patients developed HZ after reducing or discontinuing immunosuppressive drugs, with mild and stable disease activity. In four of these cases, disease activity increased after dose reduction or discontinuation, and HZ subsequently developed. Two of the seven patients who did not reduce or discontinue immunosuppressive drugs received the COVID-19 vaccination. Fifteen patients (75%) had at least one of the two IRIS triggers. Four of the five patients who developed HZ without any IRIS triggers were at HZ risk. To conclude, IRIS, caused by the reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppressive drugs, may be involved in the development of HZ in rheumatology practice.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) is a painful condition caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. The objectives of this study were to compare HZ incidence in adults with asthma versus adults without asthma and to compare healthcare resource use as well as direct costs in adults with HZ and asthma versus adults with asthma alone in the USA. Methods:This retrospective longitudinal cohort study included adults aged ≥18 years across the USA. Patients were identified from Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database, an administrative claims database, between 1 October 2015 and 28 February 2020, including commercially insured and Medicare Advantage with part D beneficiaries. Cohorts of patients with and without asthma, and separate cohorts of patients with asthma and HZ and with asthma but not HZ, were identified using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. HZ incidence, healthcare resource use and costs were compared, adjusting for baseline characteristics, between the relevant cohorts using generalised linear models. Results:HZ incidence was higher in patients with asthma (11.59 per 1000 person-years) than patients without asthma (7.16 per 1000 person-years). The adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) for HZ in patients with asthma, compared with patients without asthma, was 1.34 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.37). Over 12 months of follow-up, patients with asthma and HZ had more inpatient stays (aIRR 1.11; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.21), emergency department visits (aIRR 1.26; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.34) and outpatient visits (aIRR 1.19; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.22), and direct healthcare costs that were US dollars ($) 3058 (95% CI $1671 to $4492) higher than patients with asthma without HZ. Conclusion:Patients with asthma had a higher incidence of HZ than those without asthma, and among patients with asthma HZ added to their healthcare resource use and costs.",

        "abstract": "Aim:Herpes zoster is rarely seen in children, but is more common and more severe in those with underlying medical conditions. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate cases of herpes zoster in all paediatric patients and to detail the clinical course and complications of this disease in children with and without underlying health problems in terms of similarities and differences. Methods:The course of paediatric patients diagnosed with herpes zoster in a tertiary university hospital over a 19-year period was evaluated from the time of diagnosis, divided into groups with and without underlying disease. Results:In our study, where we evaluated 150 herpes zoster attacks in 143 children, 79.3% of the patients (n = 119) had underlying diseases, while 20.7% (n = 31) were healthy children. The age at the time of primary varicella-zoster virus and herpes zoster was significantly younger in the group without an underlying disease compared to the group with an underlying disease. Pain was reported more in the healthy group, and the duration of symptoms was longer. Ophthalmic nerve involvement was significantly higher in the group without a known disease. Treatment was administered in 90% of all attacks. In the group with underlying diseases, the duration of intravenous treatment and hospital stay were significantly higher as expected. Conclusions:This study shows that herpes zoster attacks in healthy children can also progress with severe symptoms and complications. Approaches to reduce the burden of herpes zoster should be adopted and developed for all paediatric patients.",

        "abstract": "The role of T cell receptor (TCR) diversity in infectious disease susceptibility is not well understood. We use a systems immunology approach on three cohorts of herpes zoster (HZ) patients and controls to investigate whether TCR diversity against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) influences the risk of HZ. We show that CD4+T cell TCR diversity against VZV glycoprotein E (gE) and immediate early 63 protein (IE63) after 1-week culture is more restricted in HZ patients. Single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of VZV-specific T cells shows that T cell activation pathways are significantly decreased after stimulation with VZV peptides in convalescent HZ patients. TCR clustering indicates that TCRs from HZ patients co-cluster more often together than TCRs from controls. Collectively, our results suggest that not only lower VZV-specific TCR diversity but also reduced functional TCR affinity for VZV-specific proteins in HZ patients leads to lower T cell activation and consequently affects the susceptibility for viral reactivation.",

        "abstract": "Background:Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common surgical procedure for osteoarthritis (OA) patients. TKR may increase susceptibility to herpes zoster (HZ) by inducing immunosuppression, surgical stress, and nerve injury. However, limited data exist on the relationship between TKR and HZ. This study examined the risk of HZ over time among OA patients who underwent TKR and those who did not, using a large population-based cohort.Method:Utilizing the TriNetX research network, people with OA and underwent TKR were recruited as case group. After 1:1 propensity score matching, OA patients who never experienced TKR were included as control group. Covariates, including demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data, were balanced using propensity score matching. A 5-year follow-up assessed the hazard ratio of incident HZ and related complications.Results:Compared to the control group, a significantly elevated risk of HZ was observed in the TKR cohort across 5-year follow-up period, with the hazard ratio of 1.223 (95% CI: 1.089-1.373). Zoster without complications presented 1.173-fold risk in TKR patients while comparing with non-TKR controls. However, most other secondary outcomes related to HZ complications-such as encephalitis, neurological involvement, ocular disease, and disseminated zoster-did not show a significant increase in risk. The risk of HZ was statistically significant for females and older adults in the TKR cohort than in the control cohort.Conclusions:OA patients who underwent TKR had an increased risk of HZ compared to those who did not receive the procedure, especially females and older adults. These findings highlight the need for HZ monitoring/prevention protocols and further research on mitigating viral reactivation after major joint surgery.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster is a common disease that can affect men and women at any age. Sensory neuropathy is the most common complication while motor neuropathy of the abdominal muscles is rare complication appearing in ~ 0.7% of patients. Furthermore, visceral nerve involvement causing gastroparesis is an extremely rare postherpetic complication. We present an extremely rare case of acute gastric dilatation with segmented abdominal paresis as a rare manifestation of herpes zoster infection. Case presentation:A 91-year-old Asian man was admitted to hospital with 2-day history of vomiting and left abdominal protrusion. He was previously treated for a rash on the left abdominal wall as herpes zoster infection with oral valaciclovir 2 weeks prior. On physical examination, characteristic herpes zoster rash scars and an ipsilateral abdominal bulge were observed on the left side. Computed tomography revealed no abdominal wall defect, mass, or stenosis. Remarkable distension of the stomach, asymmetrical left flank wall bulge, and a thinner abdominal wall on the left compared with the right side were shown. He was diagnosed as acute gastric dilatation owing to gastroparesis and segmental paresis of the abdominal musculature associated with herpes zoster infection. The patient showed significant improvement in symptoms and abdominal paresis within a month of conservative treatment, including nasogastric tube decompression and mosapride administration. Conclusion:Acute gastric dilatation with abdominal paresis is an extremely rare complication of herpes zoster infection, and to date there have been no reports in the literature. It alerts us that, when examining patients with abdominal bulge, we should be conscious of this rare pathology for the optical diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary invasive examination or surgical exploration.",

        "title": "Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus Initially Diagnosed As Cluster Headache, Complicated by Delayed Eruption",
        "abstract": "Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) manifests as a consequence of the reactivation of the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and primarily affects the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Identification of the vesicular eruption is central to the diagnostic process; however, the delayed manifestation of this cutaneous phenomenon poses a challenge to timely and accurate diagnosis. This report elucidates the case of a 61-year-old Japanese male with painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to VZV that was initially diagnosed as cluster headache, mainly due to the delayed cutaneous eruption. Contrary to the expected pattern of cluster headache presentations, there was no discernible fluctuation in headache severity. The transient improvement of symptoms following interventions tailored for cluster headache management, including pure oxygen inhalation and subcutaneous sumatriptan injection, inadvertently contributed to a delay in accurate diagnosis. The importance of distinguishing HZO from cluster headache is emphasized, particularly in cases involving elderly patients or those with persistent cephalo-ophthalmalgia without the characteristic fluctuation of symptoms. In cases where clinical suspicion of HZO is raised, cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed. This approach is consistent with the overall goal of facilitating a prompt and accurate diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Several concerns have been raised about a causal relationship between COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines and the development of herpes zoster (HZ). We performed a prospective analysis of the Vax-On-Third-Profile study to investigate the incidence of HZ after the third dose of mRNA-BNT162b2 (tozinameran) and its correlation with immune responses. Patients who had received a booster dose and had been actively treated for at least 8 weeks were eligible. Serologic assessment was performed before the third dose of tozinameran (timepoint-1) and 4 weeks later (timepoint-2). We also assessed the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections at predefined time points. The current analysis included 310 patients, of whom 109 (35.2%) and 111 (35.8%) were being treated with targeted therapies and cytotoxic chemotherapy, respectively. All participants received a third dose of tozinameran between September 26 and October 30, 2021. After a mean follow-up of 17.3 (IQR 15.1-18.4) months, HZ occurred in 8 recipients, for a cumulative incidence of 2.6%, and an incidence rate of 0.310 per person-year (95% CI 0.267-0.333). All HZ cases occurred within 30 days of booster dosing (range 5-29 days), with a median time to onset of 15 (IQR 9-22) days. Among the 7 patients (2.2%) who also contracted a SARS-CoV-2 infection, all cases preceded COVID-19 outbreaks. No instances of complicated HZ were reported. In multivariate analysis, impaired T helper and T cytotoxic cell counts independently correlated with HZ occurrence. These findings provide the first evidence that cancer patients on active treatment have a not negligible risk of developing HZ within 30 days after the third dose of tozinameran. The favorable clinical outcome of all observed cases confirms that protective effects of boosters in reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 outweigh the potential risk of HZ occurrence.",

        "abstract": "The Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), classified as a neurotropic member of the Herpesviridae family, exhibits a characteristic pathogenicity, predominantly inducing varicella, commonly known as chickenpox, during the initial infectious phase, and triggering the reactivation of herpes zoster, more commonly recognized as shingles, following its emergence from a latent state. The pathogenesis of VZV-associated neuroinflammation involves a complex interplay between viral replication within sensory ganglia and immune-mediated responses that contribute to tissue damage and dysfunction. Upon primary infection, VZV gains access to sensory ganglia, establishing latent infection within neurons. During reactivation, the virus can spread along sensory nerves, triggering a cascade of inflammatory mediators, chemokines, and immune cell infiltration in the affected neural tissues. The role of both adaptive and innate immune reactions, including the contributions of T and B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, in orchestrating the immune-mediated damage in the central nervous system is elucidated. Furthermore, the aberrant activation of the natural defence mechanism, characterised by the dysregulated production of immunomodulatory proteins and chemokines, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of VZV-induced neurological disorders, such as encephalitis, myelitis, and vasculopathy. The intricate balance between protective and detrimental immune responses in the context of VZV infection emphasises the necessity for an exhaustive comprehension of the immunopathogenic mechanisms propelling neuroinflammatory processes. Despite the availability of vaccines and antiviral therapies, VZV-related neurological complications remain a significant concern, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. Elucidating these mechanisms might facilitate the emergence of innovative immunomodulatory strategies and targeted therapies aimed at mitigating VZV-induced neuroinflammatory damage and improving clinical outcomes. This comprehensive understanding enhances our grasp of viral pathogenesis and holds promise for pioneering therapeutic strategies designed to mitigate the neurological ramifications of VZV infections.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) is a prevalent disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and associated with chronic morbidity, particularly with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been associated with an increased risk of HZ, mainly when immunosuppressive treatment (IMT) is used. However, studies assessing the risk of HZ in IBD are scarce. Aims:To evaluate the incidence rate and risk factors of HZ in IBD. Methods:Retrospective study in IBD patients with a positive VVZ serology from two referral hospitals from the area of Barcelona. Diagnosis of HZ and its clinical features were recorded. Results:A total of 398 IBD patients with a positive IgG-VVZ serology were identified. Fifty-eight percent of the patients received IMT (46.5% immunosuppressants monotherapy, 20.6% biologics monotherapy and, 32.7% combination therapy). After a median follow-up of 71 months (IQR 41.5-138.0), 17 (4.3%) patients developed HZ (cumulative incidence of 5.2 per 1000 person-year), 12 of them (70.6%) while receiving IMT. Median age at HZ episode was 38 years (IQR 27.5-52.5). Two (11%) developed PHN. Biological therapy was the only risk factor for developing HZ (OR 3.8 IC 95% 1.3-11.5; p=0.018). Conclusions:HZ is quite prevalent in IBD, occurring at early ages and particularly among patients using IMT. NPH appears to occur in a notable proportion of cases.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster is more prevalent among the older adult due to the age-related immune decline, leading to significant pain and complications. Although vaccination effectively prevents viral infections, vaccine hesitancy remains a major barrier to achieving high vaccination rates.To address this, we conducted a qualitative survey using Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix and 5C model to understand and improve vaccination rates in this group. Methods:Descriptive qualitative research design based on the philosophical underpinnings of naturalistic inquiry and purposive sampling methodology was conducted on adults aged 50 and above, as well as community health workers. Data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth personal interviews. The interview outline was constructed following a comprehensive review of the literature and consideration of the theoretical framework. Results:Seventeen adults over 50 years and four community healthcare workers were included in this study. The study found that information asymmetry in immunization planning was evident at all stages of vaccine supply, dissemination and demand. The main manifestations included limited access to authoritative information, insufficient community awareness of herpes zoster as a route of vaccination, insufficient vocational training, significant gaps in vaccine knowledge, and high levels of complacency among individual residents. Conclusion:Herpes zoster vaccine hesitancy is prevalent among middle-aged and older adults in China due to information asymmetry, vaccine complacency, inadequate community services, and other multiple layers of factors. Public health strategies should aim to reduce cognitive biases and information gaps by disseminating diverse and credible vaccine information through social media, medical institutions, and offline channels to promote higher vaccination rates.",

        "abstract": "Background:The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), consisting of varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE) and the AS01Badjuvant system, effectively prevents herpes zoster (HZ). In the absence of a well-defined correlate of protection, it is important to monitor the RZV immune response, as a proxy of clinical effectiveness. Methods:This systematic review examined post-vaccination parameters: humoral and cell-mediated immunity, avidity index, geometric mean concentration of antibody (GMC), and immunity persistence. The meta-analysis used a random-effects model, and subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Results:Among 37 included articles, after one month from RZV-dose 2, the pooled response rate for anti-gE humoral immunity was 95.2% (95%CI 91.9-97.2), dropping to 77.6% (95%CI 64.7-86.8) during immunosuppression. The anti-gE cell-mediated immunity-specific response reached 84.6% (95%CI 75.2-90.9). Varying factors, such as age, sex, coadministration with other vaccines, prior HZ, or live-attenuated zoster vaccine, did not significantly affect response rates. RZV induced a substantial increase in gE avidity. Immunity persistence was confirmed, with more rapid waning in the very elderly. Conclusions:This systematic review indicates that RZV elicits robust immunogenicity and overcomes immunocompromising conditions. The findings underscore the need for further research, particularly on long-term immunity, and have the potential to support HZ vaccination policies and programs.",

Overall this poses a challenge for healthcare systems. Methods:In our interdisciplinary, single-centre retrospective analysis, we aimed to assess the burden of the disease within the Department of Dermatology and the Eye Centre from the Medical Centre, University of Freiburg from 2009-2022. We obtained data from 3034 cases coded using the ICD-10 B02.x. Patients were characterised by sex, age, year of treatment, and type of treatment (inpatient vs. outpatient). Results:Overall we observed a 200% increase in the number of herpes zoster patients over the 13-year period. Upon closer analysis, this was mainly due to a rise in inpatient treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Conclusions:If the incidence of herpes zoster ophthalmicus continues to increase at the current rate the number of hospitalisations of zoster ophthalmicus would double by 2040, assuming guideline-appropriate treatment. Overall, the results show a growing need for inpatient ophthalmological care.",

        "abstract": "Background:Evidence suggests that some infectious diseases, such as herpes zoster (HZ), are associated with elevated risk of subsequent dementia, while certain anti-viral medications are associated with lower risk. We sought to evaluate associations between HZ diagnosis and treatment with incident dementia in a large, retrospective matched cohort. Methods:Using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records, we identified members of Kaiser Permanente Northwest age 50 and older from 2000-2019 with a HZ diagnosis during this period. A comparison group without HZ diagnosis was individually matched 3:1 on age at HZ diagnosis date (index date), sex, and membership length prior to index date. We excluded subjects with dementia diagnosed before the index date. Antiherpetic medication was identified using pharmacy fills 1 month before to 12 months after the index date. We employed survival analysis to examine the associations between dementia and HZ diagnosis and antiherpetic medication, adjusting multivariable models for demographic and clinical factors. We stratified on age and sex and conducted a sensitivity analysis with a 5-year lag period. Result:The study included 101,328 persons, 25,332 with HZ. Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 6,000 developed dementia. HZ diagnosis was not associated with higher hazard of dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.05) in the primary analysis. Among persons with HZ diagnoses, the HR for receipt of any antiherpetic medication was 0.79 (95% CI 0.70-0.90) in univariate analysis and 0.88 (95% CI 0.77-1.00) after adjustment for demographic and clinical factors. Dementia was not associated with trends in duration of medication use or cumulative dose. Conclusions:We found little evidence for an association between HZ diagnosis and dementia overall. Antiherpetic medication prescribed around the time of HZ diagnosis was statistically associated with lower risk of subsequent dementia in some but not all analyses and subgroups.",

Few real-life data about RZV safety are available in target populations. Objectives:This study investigates Adverse Events Following Immunization(AEFIs), baseline disease flare-ups, and Herpes Zoster (HZ) episodes occurring after RZV administration in a heterogeneous population of fragile patients to design its safety profile. Methods:This is a retrospective population-based study. RZV-vaccinated patients at Bari Policlinico General Hospital vaccination clinic from October 1st, 2021, to March 31st, 2023, were enrolled. Subjects were screened for reason of RZV eligibility and baseline chronic pathologies. AEFIs occurred in the first 7-days post-vaccination period were collected, and baseline disease flare-ups and post-vaccination HZ episodes were assessed via a 3-month follow-up. Results:Five-hundred-thirty-eight patients were included and total of 1,031 doses were administered. Most patients were vaccinated due to ongoing immunosuppressive therapy(54.65 %); onco-hematological and cardiovascular conditions were the most common chronic baseline pathologies. Out of 1,031 follow-ups, 441 AEFI cases were reported(42.7/100). The most common symptoms were injection site pain/itching(35.60/100), asthenia/malaise(11.44/100), and fever (10.09/100). Four serious AEFIs occurred(0.38/100). Older age, male sex, and history of cardiovascular diseases(OR:0.71; 95CI:0.52-0.98; p-value <0.05) were found to decrease AEFIs risk, while endocrine-metabolic illnesses(OR:1.61; 95CI:1.15-2.26; p-value <0.05) increased it. Twelve patients(2.23 %) reported a flare-up/worsening of their baseline chronic condition within the first three months after vaccination(mean interval 31.75 days, range 0-68 days). Patients with rheumatological illnesses had a higher risk of relapse(OR:16.56; 95CI:3.58-76.56; p-value <0.001), while male sex behaved as a protective factor. Twelve patients who completed the vaccination cycle(2.43%) had at least one HZ episode by the long-term follow-up. Conclusions:The study demonstrates RZV safety in a significant number of high-risk patients. Hence, RZV should be actively offered as part of tailored vaccination programs to decrease the burden of HZ in fragile populations.",

        "abstract": "All orbital tissues, including extra-ocular muscles, can be affected by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). However, only a minority of all individuals with herpes zoster infections present with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The present study reports the case of a middle-aged male patient presenting with an acute intractable right-sided headache. His neurological examination yielded normal results. The analysis of cerebrospinal fluid by biochemistry and cultural analysis yielded normal results; however, the analysis of this fluid using polymerase chain reaction yielded a positive result for VZV. Thus, treatment with acyclovir was commenced. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a bilateral intraorbital intraconal enhancement consistent with myositis. His symptoms evolved into a shock-like pain over the scalp associated with painful ocular movements. On the 2nd day of admission, he developed new vesicular lesions found on the right-side cranial nerve V1 dermatome. By the 6th day of admission, he was asymptomatic, and his physical examination revealed the resolution of the dermatologic manifestations of the VZV. The patient was stable for outpatient follow-up with ophthalmology and was discharged on an oral valacyclovir course for 7 days. To the authors' knowledge, there are four cases reported in the literature of herpes zoster ophthalmicus with orbital myositis prior to the appearance of vesicular lesions. Thus, it is suggested that VZV serology be investigated before a final diagnosis of idiopathic orbital myositis is made.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Immunizations have long been pivotal in preventing diseases like HZ (herpes zoster), caused by VZV (varicella zoster virus). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the RZV (recombinant zoster vaccine) compared to the ZVL (zoster vaccine live) and to report rare adverse events following RZV administration. Observation:Herein, we report an unusual case of a 59-year-old man who developed a V1-limited rash with a positive HZ PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test following administration of RZV in the United States. Conclusion:The development of RZV has significantly improved the prevention of HZ compared to ZVL. Nevertheless, rare adverse events, such as dermatomal reactions, underscore the importance of ongoing monitoring and research into the immunomodulatory effects of RZV. Physicians should continue to administer the RZV to patients but be cognizant that reactivation may rarely subsequently occur. Case presentation:The patient with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia was treated at an outside hospital two days after receiving the RZV complaining of paresthesia and a rash on his nasolacrimal area and forehead. The patient presented to the ED (emergency department), 9 days post-vaccination due to persistence of his symptoms despite use of amoxicillin, valacyclovir, and an unidentified eye drop. The dose of valacyclovir was increased, and he completed 1 g TID (three times a day) PO (per orally) for 10 days with subsequent resolution of symptoms. A positive PCR test confirmed the diagnosis of HZ. Topical mupirocin ointment was initiated and the patient was referred for ophthalmologic evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Key Points:Among intravenous antivirals, acyclovir was associated with the highest risk of hospital-acquired AKI, followed by penciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet.The risk of hospital-acquired AKI was dose dependent for intravenous nucleoside analogs. Among intravenous antivirals, acyclovir was associated with the highest risk of hospital-acquired AKI, followed by penciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet. The risk of hospital-acquired AKI was dose dependent for intravenous nucleoside analogs. Background:To examine the association of use of different antivirals with hospital-acquired AKI among Chinese adults with herpes zoster. Methods:This study selected 3273 adult patients who received antiviral therapy for herpes zoster during hospitalization from the China Renal Data System. We identified and staged AKI using patient-level serum creatinine data according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria. We compared the relative risks of hospital-acquired AKI among patients treated with different antivirals using Cox proportional hazards models. Results:Among 3273 patients, 1480 (45%), 681 (21%), 489 (15%), and 623 (19%) were treated with acyclovir/valacyclovir, ganciclovir, penciclovir/famciclovir, and foscarnet, respectively. During the follow-up period, a total of 111 cases of hospital-acquired AKI occurred, predominantly classified as AKI stage 1. The cumulative incidences of hospital-acquired AKI were 5%, 3%, 3%, and 1% in the patients receiving acyclovir/valacyclovir, ganciclovir, penciclovir/famciclovir, and foscarnet, respectively. Compared with acyclovir/valacyclovir, penciclovir/famciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet were associated with a lower risk of hospital-acquired AKI, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.94) and 0.27 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.63), respectively. Compared with intravenous acyclovir, intravenous penciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet were associated with a lower risk of hospital-acquired AKI with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.98) and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.76), respectively. The associations were consistent across various subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions:Among antiviral therapies for herpes zoster, we found different risks of hospital-acquired AKI among the patients receiving different antivirals, in particular, those administered intravenously. Among intravenous antivirals, acyclovir was associated with the highest risk of hospital-acquired AKI, followed by penciclovir/ganciclovir and foscarnet. Confirmation studies with large samples from other populations are warranted.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant zoster vaccine has been recommended by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) in immunocompetent adults aged at least 50 years since 2018. In January 2022, this was extended to immunodeficient/immunosuppressed adults aged at least 19 years. Key study objectives were to assess specialists' knowledge of the ACIP HZ vaccination recommendations, their attitudes toward HZ vaccination, and HZ vaccination practices/barriers. This cross-sectional, web-based survey (conducted in March 2022) included US dermatologists, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, oncologists, and rheumatologists who treat patients with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency syndrome, solid tumors/hematological malignancies, and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Although most of the 613 specialists correctly identified the ACIP HZ vaccination recommendations for adults aged at least 50 years (84%) and immunodeficient/immunosuppressed adults aged at least 19 years (67%), only 29% knew that recombinant zoster vaccine is recommended for individuals who have previously received zoster vaccine live, and only 18% knew all current ACIP recommendations. For patients with the diseases listed, 84% of specialists thought that HZ is a serious risk, 75% that HZ vaccination is extremely/very important, and 69% were extremely/very likely to recommend HZ vaccination. Only 36% administer vaccines themselves, mainly because patients receive vaccinations from others. Barriers to vaccination included more urgent/acute issues, insufficient time, and lack of patient motivation/willingness. Full knowledge of the ACIP HZ vaccination recommendations among the surveyed specialists was low. There may be a need to educate specialists to improve adherence to these recommendations.

        "abstract": "Background:A nudge intervention against Herpes Zoster, created and implemented in Italy, is presented in order to administer the Shingrix vaccine on a sample of frail patients, as required by the National Prevention Plan. Individual and contextual factors associated with vaccine adherence were investigated. Method:300 frail adult subjects underwent a full vaccine cycle with recombinant-Shingrix vaccine (RZV vaccine). Hospital Presidia of the Salerno University Hospital Authority, a Hospital Presidium of the Salerno Local Health Authority, and the Public Health Laboratory of the University of Salerno (Campania) participated in the intervention. An ad hoc questionnaire was administered with the following scales: EQ-5D, PSS-10, MSPSS, and representations of HZ and its consequences. Results:Some variables, such as peer support, doctor-patient relationship, level of education, and perception of health, are important in vaccine adherence and information processing. The following factors emerged from the factor analysis: Trust in collective knowledge and collective responsibility (F1); beliefs about virus risk and vaccine function (F2); information about virus and symptomatology (F3); and vaccine distrust (F4). Factor 4 correlates negatively with social support indices (R = -0.363;p< 0.001). There is a significant relationship between factor 3 and satisfaction with national information campaigns (F = 3.376; gdl = 5;p-value = 0.006). Conclusions:Future vaccination campaigns should be built with the aim of personalizing information and developing contextualized strategies, starting from understanding the stakeholders involved, cultural contexts, and organizational settings.",

        "abstract": "Background:The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix®, GSK) is a subunit vaccine that has been approved for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults. Co-administration of two vaccines in a single visit is a strategy to improve overall vaccine coverage. Objectives:This review aims to consolidate available clinical data on RZV co-administration, providing an overview of safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Methods:RZV co-administration data were obtained from five randomised, open-label, phase III clinical trials with similar study designs. The co-administered vaccines included: quadrivalent seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4;NCT01954251), 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23;NCT02045836), reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap;NCT02052596), 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13;NCT03439657) and COVID-19 mRNA-1273 booster (NCT05047770). Eligible participants were healthy adults aged ≥50 years. Results:A total of 3,974 participants were vaccinated (co-administration: 1,973; sequential: 2,001) across the five trials. Vaccine response rates to RZV were similar for co-administration (range: 95.8-99.1 %) and sequential groups (range: 95.1-99.1 %). Immune responses to RZV and the other vaccines (with the exception of pertactin) were non-inferior when the vaccines were co-administered compared with sequentially administered. Overall incidences of solicited local and general adverse events (AEs), unsolicited AEs, serious AEs or potential immune-mediated diseases were similar after co-administration or sequential administration. Myalgia was the most common solicited systemic AE (co-administration: 38-64 %; sequential: 30-59 %). Shivering and fever were more common after co-administration (16 % and 21 %, respectively) than after sequential administration (both 7 %) of RZV and PPSV23. Conclusions:Co-administration of RZV with routine vaccines does not significantly alter the reactogenicity, immunogenicity or safety of RZV or the co-administered vaccine. Healthcare practitioners should consider routine co-administration of RZV with other adult vaccines to improve vaccination coverage.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Little is known about the dermatological manifestations associated with COVID-19 vaccines. The aim of the study was to determine how many cases of herpes zoster (HZ) occurred after COVID-19 vaccination and to see if there was a possible link. Methods:A retrospective cohort study was performed by archive scan between 2016 and 2020, and between January 2021 and January 2022. Patients diagnosed with HZ were enrolled and their demographic and medical history including age, sex, previous systemic disease, history of COVID-19 vaccination prior to HZ symptom onset, COVID-19 vaccine type as mRNA or inactive, time to HZ onset after vaccination, and number of COVID-19 vaccines before HZ symptom onset were recorded. Results:The average annual number of HZ cases from 2016 to 2020 was 271, but the number of HZ cases in 2021 was 338, reflecting an increase. The number of HZ patients with a known history of COVID-19 vaccination in 2021 was 117 and their mean age was 57.6 ± 14.2 years. Females were 59.8% (n = 70) and 28.2% (n = 33) had chronic diseases. A positive history of COVID-19 vaccination was present in 35.9% (n = 42) of HZ patients, 11.1% (n = 13) had received mRNA vaccines and 24.8% (n = 29) had received inactive COVID-19 vaccine. Mean time to HZ after COVID-19 vaccination was 24.6 ± 16.3 days. Conclusion:An important finding of this study is the high rate (35.9%) of COVID-19 vaccination among people diagnosed with HZ. As COVID-19 vaccination may be associated with reactivation of varicella zoster virus, the vaccination history should be obtained in HZ patients.",

        "abstract": "Background/objectives:Studies have reported an association between herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and stroke. We sought to validate this association with rigorous controls for both medical comorbidities and social factors using a nationwide U.S. administrative medical claims database. Subjects/methods:A two-step approach was taken: first a retrospective case-control study was performed, followed by a self-controlled case series (SCCS). For the case control study, cox proportional hazard regression with inverse proportional treatment weighting assessed the hazard for stroke. In the SCCS, incidence of stroke was compared prior to and after the diagnosis of HZO. Results:For the case-control study, 25,720 cases and 75,924 controls met our eligibility criteria. 1712 (6.7%) and 4544 (6.0%) strokes occurred in the case and control groups respectively, conferring an 18% increased risk of stroke in the observed 1-year post-HZO period (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12-1.25, p < 0.001). SCCS analysis showed the risk for stroke was highest in the month immediately after HZO episode compared to any other time range (1-30 days after, relative risk 1.58, p < 0.001) and even higher when assessing time more distal time points prior to the HZO diagnosis (days 1-30 after HZO diagnosis had RR = 1.69 (95% CI: 1.38-2.07) and RR = 1.93 (95% CI: 1.55-2.39) compared with days -120 to -91 and -150 to -121 prior to index, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions:After accounting for stroke risk factors, our analysis confirms the association between HZO and stroke, with highest risk in the immediate month after an episode.",

Methods:A systematic computerized search was conducted in October 2023 in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, VIP, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing gabapentin analogs for the treatment of acute HZ neuralgia were searched. Endpoints were visual analog scores (Visual Analog Scale) and adverse effects at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Data from studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted for meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis using Revman 5.4 and Stata16. Results:The study included 292 patients from 6 RCTs. Of these, 118 were in the gabapentin-treated group, 37 were in the pregabalin-treated group, and 137 were in the placebo-controlled group. The gabapentin group showed superior pain reduction compared with the placebo group ( P < 0.05), but adverse events were more frequent. Conclusion:Gabapentin can effectively reduce acute HZ neuralgia in patients. Pregabalin requires additional RCTs to supplement the analysis.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To identify major contributors, current research status, and to forecast research trends and future development prospects on acupuncture and moxibustion therapy for herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Methods:A systematic search was conducted on the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu, WanFang databases, and the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), PubMed, and Scopus databases. The search strategy included relevant terms for HZ, PHN, acupuncture, and moxibustion. The reference type was limited to articles or reviews, with a publication date from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2023. Data analysis was performed using CiteSpace software, focusing on author, institution, source, and keyword distributions, and temporal trends. Results:A total of 1612 publications were identified from both Chinese and English databases. The analysis revealed a rising trend in publication numbers in the English database, with a significant increase observed in 2020. In the Chinese database, publication activity exhibited two peaks in 2019 and 2023. Guohua Lin and Jingchun Zeng were the most prolific authors in the Chinese and English databases, respectively. The Chengdu University of TCM and Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University were the most active institutions. The keyword analysis revealed \"herpes zoster\" as the most frequent keyword in the Chinese database, while \"postherpetic neuralgia,\" \"acupuncture,\" and \"management\" were prominent in the English database. The study also identified several therapeutic approaches, including fire needle therapy and electroacupuncture, which have shown efficacy in treating HZ and PHN. Animal studies provided insights into the mechanisms of these therapies, suggesting potential modulation of neuroinflammatory markers and intracellular signaling pathways.

        "abstract": "(1) Background: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a disease caused by the reactivation of the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). Clinical reactivation, herpes zoster, takes place in 10-20% of subjects who contracted the primary infection, with a higher risk of developing zoster increasing proportionally with age, especially after 50 years of age. HZ is a common clinical problem, particularly among patients aged over 50 years and immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised patients and adults could present an atypical and more severe course. In addition, they are at greater risk of complications. For this reason, it is important to understand the real burden of the disease and to identify the subjects who are at higher risk of HZ and its complications, also to direct preventive strategies at the right targets. The aim of the present study is to analyze HZ-related hospitalization trends in Abruzzo in the period of 2015-2021. (2) Methods: Data related to hospital admissions were extracted from the hospital discharge records (HDRs) of the whole region, considering all admissions during the years of 2015-2021. The trends in hospital admissions and length of stay were evaluated and analyzed. (3) Results: A total of 768 hospital discharges with a diagnosis of herpes zoster were registered in Abruzzo during the 7-year study period. During the study period, an increasing trend was observed from the year 2015 to the year 2017, ranging from 8.19 cases/100,000 to 11.5 cases/100,000 (APC (Annual percentage change) +20.8%; 95%CI -2.3; 47.6). After the year 2017, a significantly decreasing trend was observed, reaching 5.46 cases/100,000 in the year 2021 (APC -18.4%; 95%CI -31.5; -12.0). Across the entire study period, an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of -7.0% (95%CI -13.0; -1.3) was observed. (4) Conclusions: Despite the trend of a reduction in hospitalizations, this study highlights that HZ continues to have a great impact on public health. So, it is important to update recommendations for the use of the already available HZ vaccine and to implement new strategies to increase awareness of the prevention of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Acute zoster-associated pain develops in most patients with herpes zoster. Nonopioid analgesics are usually used to treat acute zoster-associated pain but are frequently ineffective. We administered intravenous fosphenytoin, the prodrug of phenytoin, to patients with acute zoster-associated pain to examine its analgesic efficacy and safety. At 13 medical institutions in Japan, we conducted a phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of intravenous fosphenytoin in Japanese inpatients with acute zoster-associated pain for whom nonopioid analgesics had shown an insufficient analgesic effect. The patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a single intravenous dose of fosphenytoin at 18 mg/kg (high dose), a single intravenous dose of fosphenytoin at 12 mg/kg (low dose), or placebo. The primary endpoint was the mean change per hour (slope) in the numerical rating scale score from the baseline score until 120 min after dosing. Seventeen patients were randomly assigned to the low-dose fosphenytoin group (n = 6, median age 62.5 years, range 39-75 years), high-dose fosphenytoin group (n = 5, median age 69.0 years, range 22-75 years), and placebo group (n = 5, median age 52.0 years, range 38-72 years). One patient was excluded because of investigational drug dilution failure. This study was discontinued because of the influences of coronavirus disease 2019. The slope was significantly lower in the high- and low-dose fosphenytoin groups than in the placebo group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.016, respectively). Responsiveness to intravenous fosphenytoin (≥2-point reduction in the numerical rating scale score from baseline to 120 min after dosing) was inferred at plasma total phenytoin concentrations of 10-15 μg/mL. Treatment-emergent adverse events caused no safety concerns in the clinical setting and intravenous fosphenytoin was well tolerated. Intravenous fosphenytoin appears to be an effective and promising alternative treatment for acute zoster-associated pain. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.govNCT04139330.",

It presents with a vesicular rash on an erythematous base similar to that seen in classical varicella, however, with only a single dermatomal distribution. The rash is usually seen throughout the affected dermatome as the dorsal root ganglia for each dermatome are clustered together. We present a case of an otherwise healthy male who developed a vesicular rash confined to the distribution of the posterior division of the mandibular nerve. Though the entire mandibular nerve arises from a single ganglion, the skin area supplied by the anterior division of the mandibular nerve was spared. This case provides evidence to show that there is anatomic segregation of cell bodies of nerves traversing anterior and posterior divisions of mandibular division in the trigeminal ganglion and that partial involvement of a sensory root ganglion is possible in immunocompetent patients.",

We then examined hospitalization risk factors for HZ within a diabetic patient cohort managed by regional diabetes clinics. Results:Of 3,423 HZ hospitalizations in 2010-2019, 17.9 % (613 cases) were diabetic patients, who exhibited higher hospitalization rates (15.9 to 6.0 per 100,000) compared to non-diabetese individuals. Among diabetics subjects risk factors for HZ hospitalization included age over 65, obesity (BMI > 30), and poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 8.0 %). These patients had a 40 % increased rehospitalization risk and a 25 % higher risk of severe complications, such as stroke and myocardial infarction, post-HZ. Conclusions:Diabetes markedly increases HZ hospitalization rates, rehospitalization, and complication risks. These findings underscore the need for preventive strategies, especially improved glycemic control among high-risk diabetic patients, to inform public health policies and clinical practices aimed at mitigating HZ's impact on this population.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two doses of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) against herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in Chinese adults at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). Chinese KPSC members were identified based on self-reported ethnicity or self-reported preferred spoken/written language. Those aged ≥50 years who received two doses of RZV 4 weeks to ≤ 6 months apart were matched 1:4 to RZV unvaccinated Chinese members and followed through June 2022; second doses were accrued 6/1/2018-12/31/2020. We estimated incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing outcomes (HZ and PHN). Adjusted VE (%) was calculated as (1-aHR)×100. 3978 RZV vaccinated Chinese members were matched to 15,912 RZV unvaccinated Chinese members. The incidence per 1000 person-years (95% CI) of HZ in the vaccinated group was 1.5 (0.9-2.5) and 10.9 (9.8-12.1) in the unvaccinated group; aHR (95% CI) was 0.12 (0.07-0.21). Adjusted VE (95% CI) was 87.6% (78.9-92.7) against HZ. We identified 0 PHN cases in the vaccinated group and 19 in the unvaccinated group. Among Chinese adults aged ≥50 years, two doses of RZV provided substantial protection against HZ and PHN supporting the real-world effectiveness of the vaccine in this population.",

        "abstract": "Aims:To present current expert practice patterns and to formulate a consensus for the management of HSV and VZV AU by uveitis specialists worldwide. Methods:A two-round online modified Delphi survey with masking of the study team was conducted. Responses were collected from 76 international uveitis experts from 21 countries. Current practices in the diagnosis and treatment of HSV and VZV AU were identified. A working group (The Infectious Uveitis Treatment Algorithm Network [TITAN]) developed data into consensus guidelines. Consensus is defined as a particular response towards a specific question meeting ≥75% of agreement or IQR ≤ 1 when a Likert scale is used. Results:Unilaterality, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), decreased corneal sensation and diffuse or sectoral iris atrophy are quite specific for HSV or VZV AU from consensus opinion. Sectoral iris atrophy is characteristic of HSV AU. Treatment initiation is highly variable, but most experts preferred valacyclovir owing to simpler dosing. Topical corticosteroids and beta-blockers should be used if necessary. Resolution of inflammation and normalisation of IOP are clinical endpoints. Conclusions:Consensus was reached on several aspects of diagnosis, choice of initial treatment, and treatment endpoints for HSV and VZV AU. Treatment duration and management of recurrences varied between experts.",

        "abstract": "A 15-year-old boy was referred for corneal opacity evaluation. The patient had a previous herpes zoster virus (HZV) infection-varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-with ocular manifestation 1 year ago. After the infection, he developed a central corneal scar and decreased corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) in the right eye. The slitlamp examination showed the right eye with central corneal opacity (involving anterior stroma), lacuna area between the haze, fluorescein negative, and no vascularization near the scar (Figure 1JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202406000-00019/figure1/v/2024-07-10T174224Z/r/image-tiff). The patient had been treated with oral valacyclovir and topical corticosteroids without any improvement of visual acuity or changes in opacity within the 1-year follow-up. His CDVA was 20/200 (-4.50 -0.75 × 25) in the right eye and counting fingers (-4.00) in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in both eyes. Fundoscopy was normal in the right eye, but he had a macular scar in the left eye (diagnosed when he was 7 years). The left eye had no cornea signs. The patient has no comorbidity or previous surgeries. Considering this case, a corneal central scar in a 15-year-old boy, legally single eye only, and assuming it is an opacity in the anterior stroma, would you consider surgery for this patient? If so, which would you choose: Would you consider an excimer laser treatment of his ametropia while partially removing his opacity, a phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), or a PTK followed by a topography-guided treatment, femtosecond laser-assisted anterior lamellar keratoplasty (FALK), or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) or penetrating keratoplasty (depending on the scar depth)? Would you consider prophylactic acyclovir during and after surgery? Would you consider any other surgical step to prevent delayed corneal healing-persistent epithelial defect? Before the surgical approach, would you consider treating this patient with topical losartan (a transforming growth factor [TGF]-β signaling inhibitor)? Would you first perform the surgery (which one) and then start the medication? Furthermore, if so, how long would you treat this patient? Would you consider treatment with another medication?",

        "abstract": "Thirty-three long-term care residents (mean age 76.5 years), who were participating in a study in which they were randomized to receive either oral daily standard dose (400-1000 IU/day) 25-hydroxy vitamin D (vitamin D3) (SD) or high dose (3000-4000 IU/day) (HD) vitamin D3, were vaccinated with the live, attenuated herpes zoster vaccine. Blood was drawn at vaccination and three weeks later to determine varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody and T-cell mediated immune responses. ELISA and neutralizing antibodies increased significantly, but to the same extent, in both groups. The antibody avidity significantly increased from pre- to post-vaccination only in the HD group. VZV-CMI, as measured by FLUOROSPOT significantly increased post-vaccination in both groups, but the difference in interferon-γ spot-forming cells (SFC) and interleukin-2 SFC was lower in the HD than SD group. The increase in VZV-CMI correlated inversely with circulating regulatory T cells in the HD group. We conclude that pre-treatment with HD vitamin D3 does not appreciably enhance the antibody response to a live vaccine and that VZV-CMI responses were diminished in HD vitamin D3 recipients.",

        "abstract": "Background:The adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine has shown good efficacy and safety in the general population. However, its effectiveness has not been comprehensively assessed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in patients with SLE. Methods:This single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial was done at the rheumatology outpatient clinic at Seoul National University Hospital, South Korea. Patients (aged ≥19 years) with clinically stable SLE and previous exposure (≥4 weeks) to immunosuppressive drugs were randomly assigned (4:1) via a central interactive web response system to receive herpes zoster subunit vaccine or placebo (0·5 mL intramuscular injection) at weeks 0 and 8. Investigators and participants were masked to intervention and group assignment. Anti-glycoprotein E antibody titres and glycoprotein E-specific cell-mediated vaccine responses were evaluated at baseline and at week 8 after the first dose, and at week 4, week 26, and week 52 after the second dose using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Reactogenicity, SLE disease activity, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-flare rate, were examined. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a positive humoral vaccine response 4 weeks after the second dose. The primary and safety analyses were done in a modified intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT06001606. Findings:Between June 14, and July 19, 2023, 65 patients with SLE were enrolled, of whom 52 were randomly assigned to the herpes zoster subunit vaccine and 13 to placebo. 49 patients in the vaccine group and 11 patients in the placebo group were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. 56 (93%) of 60 patients were women and four (7%) were men. Mean age was 48·7 years (SD 11·4). The proportion of participants with a humoral vaccine response at 4 weeks after the second dose was significantly higher in the vaccine group (48 [98%] of 49 participants) than the placebo group (none [0%] of 11 patients; p<0·0001). More patients in the vaccine group than placebo group reported injection site reactions (42 patients vs two patients), fever (ten vs none), and fatigue (26 vs two). There were no differences in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-flare rates between the groups. There were no treatment-related deaths. Interpretation:The herpes zoster subunit vaccine induces humoral and cellular immunity against herpes zoster with a good safety profile in patients with SLE. A larger study is warranted to assess the efficacy of vaccines to prevent herpes zoster in patients with SLE. Funding:Ministry of Science and ICT, The Government of the Republic of Korea.",

Methods:In this observational study, 29 patients and 39 immunocompetent controls underwent standard dual-dose vaccination. Blood samples were analysed before and two weeks after each vaccination, and after one year. Specific T-cells were characterized after stimulation with VZV-gE-peptides based on induction of cytokines and CTLA-4-expression using flow-cytometry. Antibodies were analysed using ELISA. Findings:Both groups showed an increase in VZV-gE-specific CD4 T-cell levels over time (p < 0.0001), although median levels reached after second vaccination were lower in patients (0.17% (IQR 0.21%)) than in controls (0.24% (IQR 0.3%), p = 0.042). VZV-gE specific CD8 T-cells were only poorly induced. CTLA-4 expression on VZV-gE-specific CD4 T-cells was strongest after second dose with no differences between the groups (p = 0.45). Multifunctional cells co-expressing IFNγ, IL-2, and TNF were higher in patients after first vaccination (p = 0.028). Median VZV-specific IgG-levels reached a maximum after second vaccination with significantly lower levels in patients (10796 (IQR 12482) IU/l) than in controls (16899 (IQR 14019) IU/l, p = 0.009). Despite similar CD4 T-cell levels after one year (p = 0.415), antibody levels remained significantly lower in patients (p = 0.0008). Interpretation:VZV-gE vaccination induced specific antibodies and CD4 T-cells in both patients and controls, whereas CD8 T-cell-induction was poor. Quantitative and qualitative differences in immunity may indicate reduced duration of protection which may necessitate booster vaccinations in patients on dialysis.

        "abstract": "Objective:This study aimed to reveal the efficacy of physical therapy for patients with peripheral facial palsy. Methods:A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Ichushi-Web, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Published randomized controlled trials comparing the physical therapy versus placebo/non-treatment for peripheral facial palsy such as Bell's palsy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and traumatic facial palsy were included for meta-analysis. The primary outcome was non-recovery at the end of the follow-up. Non-recovery was defined according to the authors' definition. The secondary outcomes were the composite score of the Sunnybrook facial grading system and sequelae (presence of synkinesis or hemifacial spasm) at the end of the follow-up. Data was analyzed using Review Manager software and pooled risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results:Seven randomized controlled trials met the eligible criteria. The data on non-recovery from four studies was obtained and included 418 participants in the meta-analysis. Physical therapy might reduce non-recovery (RR = 0.51 [95% CI = 0.31-0.83], low quality). Pooling the data of composite score of the Sunnybrook facial grading system from three studies (166 participants) revealed that physical therapy might increase the composite scores (MD = 12.1 [95% CI = 3.11-21.0], low quality). Moreover, we obtained data on sequelae from two articles (179 participants). The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of physical therapy on reduction of sequelae (RR = 0.64 [95% CI = 0.07-5.95], very low quality). Conclusion:The evidence suggested that physical therapy reduces non-recovery in patients with peripheral facial palsy and improves the composite score of the Sunnybrook facial grading system, whereas the efficacy of physical therapy in reducing sequelae remained uncertain. The included studies had high risk of bias, imprecision, or inconsistency; therefore, the certainty of evidence was low or very low. Further well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Background and objective:Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is approved in adults for the prevention of herpes zoster. The effect of RZV in moderating the severity of breakthrough cases of herpes zoster has been noted but not explicitly quantified before. In this study, a meta-analysis was undertaken to estimate differential utility losses between unvaccinated (Placebo) and vaccinated (RZV) subjects in breakthrough cases of herpes zoster from three RZV clinical trials. Methods:Differential utility losses between the two groups were estimated in units of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), leveraging aggregate patient data from the ZOE-50 (NCT01165177), ZOE-70 (NCT01165229), and ZOE-HSCT (NCT01610414) clinical trials. Differential utility losses and the ratio of mean utility losses were analyzed using random-effects and fixed-effects meta-regression models. Results:The mean QALY loss differences between the unvaccinated (Placebo) and vaccinated (RZV) groups were 0.008, 0.004, and 0.011 in the ZOE-50, ZOE-70, and ZOE-HSCT studies, respectively, yielding an overall estimated difference of 0.007 (95% confidence interval 0.002-0.012) QALYs. Quality-adjusted life-year loss in the vaccinated group was estimated to be 35.5% of the value in the placebo group. A sensitivity analysis estimated an overall difference of 0.005 (95% confidence interval 0.001-0.009) QALYs, corresponding to 48.6% of the QALY loss value in the placebo group. Conclusions:Recombinant zoster vaccine is effective in alleviating disease severity in breakthrough cases of herpes zoster. The results may be useful in distinguishing QALY losses between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts in health economics studies, particularly cost-effectiveness analyses.",

The diagnoses of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and acute conjunctivitis were made for the left eye. The patient was followed up for 6 months and during that period the following diagnoses were made for the same eye: peripheral sterile corneal infiltrates, episcleritis, and hypertensive anterior uveitis.Discussions:Herpes zoster ophthalmicus occurs when the reactivation of the dormant virus involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The most frequent ocular presentations are conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, episcleritis, and scleritis. The standard therapy consists of antivirals, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir to limit the replication of the virus. The patient's risk factors, the course of treatment, and the severity of the disease, all affect the prognosis, which is highly variable. Prevention of the disease consists of vaccination with one of the following two vaccines, Zostavax and Shingrix.Conclusions:Final visual acuity for the left eye remained 1 despite numerous manifestations of the disease.Abbreviations:VZV = Varicella-zoster virus, BCVA = best-corrected visual acuity, OU = both eyes, OD = right eye, OS = left eye, IOP = intraocular pressure, NCT = non-contact tonometer, ZVX = Zostavax vaccine.",

        "abstract": "Background:To investigate the risk of recurrent herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation under continued Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi) therapy in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) who developed HZ reactivation. Methods:Data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ulcerative colitis (UC) gathered from 2007 to 2021 were analyzed. Results:A total of 3947 (RA 3540, UC 407) receiving JAKi were included. After median 0.95 years (IQR, 0.93-2.58) of therapy, 611 (15.5%) patients developed HZ reactivation (incidence rate: 8.38/100 person-years [PY]). After excluding 151 patients with lack of data after HZ reactivation, 460 patients (JAKi continuation group, n = 386 [83.9%]; JAKi discontinuation group, n = 74 [16.1%]) were analyzed for the risk of subsequent recurrent HZ reactivation. During further follow-up of median 1.11 years (IQR, 0.53-1.91), 36 (9.3%) and 6 (8.1%) patients in the JAKi continuation group and JAKi discontinuation group experienced a recurrence of HZ, respectively. The incidence rate of subsequent recurrent HZ reactivation was not significantly different between the two groups (5.3/100 vs. 5.9/100 PY; P = 0.52). After adjusting for age, sex, usage of corticosteroids, and antiviral agents, continued use of JAKi was not a significant risk factor for subsequent HZ reactivation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71 [CI, 0.29-1.72], P = 0.45). Conclusion:In this nationwide population-based study on patients with RA or UC, continued use of JAKi was not associated with a significant risk of subsequent recurrent HZ reactivation. JAKi therapy may be maintained in patients with IMID even after HZ reactivation.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster (HZ), caused by the reactivation of the Varicella-Zoster virus, is typically characterized by sensory complications. However, motor complications, such as abdominal pseudohernia, are rare and exceptional. This report presents a case of post-herpes zoster pseudo-hernia in a previously healthy 54-year-old man. Case presentation:A 54-year-old Caucasian patient developed an abdominal wall protrusion over two weeks, following a resolved herpes zoster infection. Physical examination revealed healed skin lesions and a painless protrusion on the right flank, triggered by coughing, suggesting an abdominal wall hernia. Abdominal CT scan ruled out parietal but noted asymmetry in the abdominal wall muscles, particularly thinning on the right side. The diagnosis of post-herpes zoster pseudo-hernia was established, with spontaneous resolution occurring after four months. Discussion:Herpes zoster typically manifests as a sensory condition. However, motor complications can lead to muscle weakness or paralysis. Pseudo-herniation is a rare motor complication, affecting less than 1 % of cases. It must be differentiated from true abdominal wall hernias, which require surgical intervention. Pseudo-hernia typically presents as painless abdominal bulging, often asymptomatic, but can lead to gastrointestinal issues if visceral nerves are affected. Imaging studies and EMG may be employed for diagnosis. Treatment for pseudo-hernia is conservative, addressing the underlying HZ, and the prognosis is favorable, with most cases resolving within 3 to 12 months. Conclusion:Abdominal post-herpes zoster pseudo-hernia is a rare HZ complication. Recognizing this entity is crucial, as it typically resolves spontaneously without surgical intervention. This case aims to enhance awareness of this exceptional clinical manifestation.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster, or shingles, is a significant health concern for older adults caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. The availability of effective herpes zoster vaccines offers a crucial preventive measure to reduce the incidence and severity of this condition. However, the uptake of the available vaccine remains suboptimal, especially among adults aged 50 and above. Understanding the factors that influence vaccine utilization is not only essential for developing strategies to improve vaccination rates but also has the potential to significantly reduce the disease burden. Methods:This cross-sectional study aimed to identify factors influencing herpes zoster vaccine utilization among adults aged 50 and above attending primary healthcare center in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire administered to visitors attending Al-Wazarat Primary Healthcare Center in Riyadh. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to analyze the data. Results:A total of 403 participants were included in the study, with 73.7% of participants having heard of the disease, yet only 34.2% had received the vaccine. Vaccine uptake was significantly associated with gender, educational level, and healthcare provider recommendations. Common barriers to vaccination included fear of side effects, lack of perceived susceptibility, concerns about vaccine effectiveness, and access to healthcare facilities. Conclusion:Herpes zoster vaccine utilization among older adults in Saudi Arabia is relatively low despite moderate awareness. Enhancing public education through targeted campaigns and strengthening healthcare provider recommendations are crucial to improving vaccine uptake. Addressing specific barriers and misconceptions is essential to reduce the burden of herpes zoster in this population. The need for future research to explore strategies to overcome these challenges and promote higher vaccination rates is urgent and important.",

        "abstract": "Background:Coronary artery disease (CAD) and herpes zoster represent significant health burdens, and their potential interrelationships remain understudied. This cohort study aimed to address the existing knowledge gap by systematically exploring whether people with CAD are at increased risk for developing herpes zoster. Methods:Using the 2006-2015 claims data of the National Health Insurance Program in Taiwan, we identified participants aged ≥20 years with a new diagnosis of CAD as the CAD group. We selected sex- and age-matched participants without CAD as the non-CAD group. The incidence rate of herpes zoster at the end of follow-up was calculated. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to measure the hazard ratio and 95% CI for herpes zoster associated with covariables. Results:The overall incidence rate of herpes zoster was 1.14-fold greater in the CAD group as compared with the non-CAD group (6.52 vs 5.74 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.08-1.20). After controlling for covariables, the adjusted hazard ratio of herpes zoster was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.14-1.27) for the CAD group as compared with the non-CAD group. Conclusions:This cohort study provides valuable insights into the potential association between CAD and the risk of developing herpes zoster. The findings may have implications for preventive strategies of herpes zoster in people with CAD. Further research and collaboration with diverse groups will be critical to validate and extend our findings.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of herpes zoster laryngitis with vocal fold immobility. Study design:Retrospective study. Methods:Clinical characteristics, laryngeal signs on strobolaryngoscopy, imaging examination findings, and outcomes of patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results:This study included 17 patients (11 males [64.7%] and six females [35.3%]), with a mean age of 63.3 ± 6.7 years. The primary symptoms were hoarseness (94.1%), dysphagia (76.5%), pharyngalgia on one side (76.5%), and aspiration (70.6%). No patient had skin herpes of the head and neck. The duration of symptoms was 5-30 days (median: 10 days). Twelve patients (70.6%) were in an immunocompromised state before the disease. Strobolaryngoscopy showed congestion and swelling of the mucosa on one side of the larynx, with whitish eruptions on the supraglottic mucosa and ipsilateral vocal fold immobility. Five patients (29.4%) exhibited signs of ipsilateral accessory nerve injury. The imaging examination showed supraglottic inflammatory changes in 12 patients (70.6%). Among the 14 patients whose treatment could be clearly described, only one patient received antiviral treatment, whereas others received neurotrophic and symptomatic treatment. Notably, all patients demonstrated good outcomes because their symptoms eventually returned to normal. Conclusion:Herpes zoster laryngitis is caused by varicella-zoster virus infection of the vagus nerve. It is characterized by laryngeal herpetic changes on one side and unilateral vocal fold immobility. The inducement of the disease tends to be associated with the abnormal immune state of patients. It can be easily misdiagnosed because of the absence of skin herpetic changes. Regardless of antiviral therapy, patients generally exhibit a favorable outcome.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common medical condition accompanied by several distressing symptoms, including acute pain. Pien Tze Huang (PZH) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with numerous pharmacological effects, including antiviral properties, neuroprotection, and immunity regulation. Purpose:To investigate the efficacy and safety of PZH capsules in patients with HZ. Study design:A multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial from 8 hospitals in 5 cities of China. Methods:Eligible participants were randomly assigned to the PZH capsule and placebo group at a 1:1 ratio. Treatment was conducted for 14 days with a window period of no more than 2 days. For the first 7 days, participants received antiviral drugs combined with PZH capsules (0.6 g/time, 3 times a day) or placebos. For the remaining 7 days, they were only treated with PZH capsules (0.6 g/time, 3 times a day) or placebos. Results:We included 222 patients in the full analysis set (FAS), and 187 patients in the per protocol set (PPS). The change of numeric rating scale pain scores from baseline to the seventh day (±1 day) after treatment in the PZH capsule group was statistically superior to the placebo group (FAS: 2.33 vs. 1.71, 97.5%CI: 0.03 ∼ 1.19; PPS: 2.29 vs. 1.51, 97.5%CI: 0.18 ∼ 1.38). In the PPS, there was a significant difference in the time (days) of pain relief between the placebo group and the PZH capsule group (Mean (SD): 5.71 (3.76) vs. 4.69 (3.57), p = 0.046). On the seventh day (±1 day) after treatment, the level of CD8+ cells in the PZH capsule group were higher than those of the placebo group (FAS: Mean (SD): 24.08 (6.81) vs. 21.93 (8.19), p = 0.007; PPS: Mean (SD): 24.26 (6.93) vs. 22.15 (8.51), p = 0.012). The level of cytotoxic lymphocyte cells found similar results on the seventh day (±1 day) (FAS: Mean (SD): 12.17 (4.65) vs. 10.55 (4.15), p = 0.018; PPS: Mean (SD): 12.25 (4.65) vs. 10.11 (3.93), p = 0.002). No serious adverse events were noted and PZH capsules were well tolerated. Conclusion:PZH capsules confer therapeutic effects on HZ with the TCM symptom of stagnated heat of liver channel by substantially reducing the pain intensity, shortening the time of pain relief as well as regulating the immune function. On the basis of the efficacy and safety profiles, PZH capsules may be a promising complementary therapy for the treatment of HZ.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) risk is increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) therapy. Identifying and evaluating the risk factors of HZ development in patients receiving JAKi therapy would be clinically helpful. We investigated HZ's incidence rates (IR), identified the risk factors, and further assessed their influence on HZ development in RA patients undergoing JAKi therapy. We retrospectively evaluated 249 RA patients who received JAKi therapy between 2015 and 2023. Data regarding clinical characteristics, HZ reactivation, HZ vaccination status, and concomitant medication use were collected. Among 249 JAKi-treated patients, 44 developed new-onset HZ (tofacitinib, 28/142; baricitinib, 6/35; upadacitinib,10/72), with an IR of 5.11/100patient-years. Multivariate analysis revealed significant predictors of HZ development: a long JAKi exposure period, prior HZ or COVID-19 history, and concomitant high-dose corticosteroids use. The interval between JAKi initiation and HZ development was significantly shorter in patients with prior HZ history than in those without (median, 6.5 months versus 33.5 months, p < 0.001), suggesting \"biphasic\" emergence of HZ. Only one patient who had experienced an HZ episode while receiving JAKi developed recurrent HZ. None of the seventeen patients immunized with the non-live recombinant zoster vaccine developed HZ. Our JAKi-treated patients had elevated HZ risks, a class effect across different JAKi. A long exposure period, prior history of HZ or COVID-19, and concomitant high-dose corticosteroid treatment may further increase the risk. The emergence of HZ shows a biphasic pattern: early HZ development in patients with prior HZ and late development in those without. Key Points • An increased risk of HZ was observed in Taiwanese RA patients treated with JAKi, presenting as a class effect. • Patients with a long JAKi exposure period, prior history of HZ or COVID-19, and concomitant use of high-dose corticosteroids were at high risk of HZ while receiving JAKi therapy. • The interval between JAKi initiation and HZ occurrence was shorter in patients with prior HZ than in those without, showing \"biphasic\" emergence.",

        "abstract": "Background:Intestinal obstruction is a common occurrence in clinical practice. However, the occurrence of herpes zoster complicated by intestinal obstruction after abdominal surgery is exceedingly rare. In the diagnostic and treatment process, clinicians consider it crucial to identify the primary causes of its occurrence to ensure effective treatment and avoiding misdiagnosis. Case summary:Herein, we present the case of a 40-year-old female patient with intestinal obstruction who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and developed herpes zoster after surgery. Combining the patient's clinical manifestations and relevant laboratory tests, it was suggested that the varicella zoster virus reactivated during the latent period after abdominal surgery, causing herpes zoster. Subsequently, the herpes virus invaded the visceral nerve fibers, causing gastrointestinal dysfunction and loss of intestinal peristalsis, which eventually led to intestinal obstruction. The patient was successfully treated through conservative treatment and antiviral therapy and subsequently discharged from the hospital. Conclusion:Pseudo-intestinal obstruction secondary to herpes zoster infection is difficult to distinguish from mechanical intestinal obstruction owing to various causes. In cases of inexplicable intestinal obstructions, considering the possibility of a viral infection is essential to minimize misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Decreased VZV-specific T-cell immune responses significantly contribute to the development of HZ. Shingrix is a recombinant zoster vaccine that is currently used to prevent HZ. However, Shingrix has high reactogenicity and pain at the injection site due to QS21, one of the adjuvant components. In this study, we developed a new herpes zoster vaccine formulation called CVI-VZV-001, containing gE protein and a novel liposome-based adjuvant Lipo-pam™, which consists of two TLR agonists. We evaluated the immunogenicity of CVI-VZV-001 in mouse and rabbit models. CVI-VZV-001 elicited robust gE-specific T-cell immune responses and gE-specific antibody production. Specifically, CVI-VZV-001 induced polyfunctional CD4+T cell populations that secrete multiple cytokines. Furthermore, CVI-VZV-001 sustained the gE-specific immune responses for up to six months after immunization. To ensure CVI-VZV-001's safety for further development, we conducted a good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicity test, which confirmed that CVI-VZV-001 is safe for use. At present, CVI-VZV-001 is undergoing phase I clinical trials. This study suggests that CVI-VZV-001 can be a potent candidate for the HZ vaccine with high immunogenicity and safety.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) significantly affect patients' quality of life (QoL). Cultural differences may lead to different patient-reported outcomes across countries. The current study aims to evaluate the detrimental impact of HZ and PHN on QoL in China. Methods:This prospective study was conducted from January 2020 to April 2023. We used the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) and 5-level EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire to assess the QoL of HZ and PHN patients. Patients were required to complete the questionnaires at 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after the onset of the HZ rash. Additional questionnaires were administered at 120, 150, and 180 days for those who developed PHN within three months of the rash's onset. Results:A cohort of 633 patients with a median age of 63 years were included in the study. The mean delay from the appearance of the initial HZ rash to the first medical consultation was 5.1 ± 2.8 days. Approximately 30% of the HZ patients (189/633) went on to develop PHN. For patients with HZ who did not progress to PHN, the ZBPI worst pain score and impaired QoL had nearly resolved by day 90 post-rash onset. Conversely, there was no significant improvement in the ZBPI worst pain score and QoL for those with PHN, even by day 180 post-rash onset. Conclusion:Both HZ and PHN significantly impaired patients' QoL. However, the impairment caused by PHN was more severe in both intensity and duration.",

        "abstract": "Background:We present a case of a 29-year-old male patient without immunodeficiency who suffered from rapid osteonecrosis and tooth exfoliation resulting from herpes zoster (HZ) infection in the left maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve. Various complications associated with shingles infections have been reported, cases of osteonecrosis and tooth exfoliation due to HZ infection among young people without immunodeficiency are rare. In this case, we focus on the particular manifestation of HZ infection. Case presentation:The patient presented with clusters of erythema and papules, along with non-hemorrhagic blisters on the left face and the loss of the left upper incisor. All lesions were localized to the left side of the face without exceeding the midline. After receiving antibacterial and antiviral treatment, successful control over the infection was achieved; however, he experienced the loss of all upper teeth on the left side except for the first and second upper left molars. Conclusion:This case highlights that rapid osteonecrosis and tooth exfoliation may occur among young individuals without immunodeficiency after HZ infection. HZ infection of the face should be taken very seriously to obtain prompt treatment to prevent the rare complications of bone necrosis and tooth loss as much as possible.",

        "title": "Efficacy and safety of therapies related to acupuncture for acute herpes zoster: A PRISMA systematic review and network meta-analysis",
        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) is mainly characterized by intense pain and severe skin lesions, particularly during the acute phase, which seriously affects the patient's quality of life. Acupuncture is a widely used and effective treatment for HZ. However, there are many types of acupuncture, which have different curative efficacy. This study employed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess and rank the clinical efficacy of different acupuncture therapies. Methods:The database of Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese BioMedical Database, VIP Database, and Wanfang Database were searched from inception to December 31, 2022 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture related therapies in the treatment of acute HZ. The outcome indicators measured were visual analogue scale (VAS), date of cessation of herpes increase (DCHI), effective rate (ER), postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), and adverse events (AEs). Bayesian network meta-analyses were performed using the GeMTC package (version 1.0-1) and R software (version 4.2.3). Results:A total of 59 RCTs with 3930 patients were included. The results of this NMA were as follows: compared with pharmacotherapy, electroacupuncture (EA) + pricking and cupping (PC) shown the best efficacy to improve VAS score and reduce DCHI. In terms of ER, EA + fire needle (FN) had the highest results of probability ranking. PC was more effective in reducing the incidence of PHN. Furthermore, this study shown that the incidence of AEs associated with acupuncture-related therapies was acceptable. Conclusions:This study indicated that therapies related to acupuncture were both effective and safe in treating acute HZ, and could significantly reduce patients' symptoms such as pain and skin lesions with fewer adverse events. Clinically, the selection of the appropriate therapy should be based on practical considerations. However, due to the limitations of this study, more high-quality trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture-related therapy for the treatment of acute HZ.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Vaccination against preventable infections is important for the management of rheumatic diseases (RDs). This study assessed the vaccination coverage and predictors among patients with RDs using real-world data from Israel. Methods:This retrospective cross-sectional study, based on a Maccabi Healthcare Services database, included adult patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as of April 30, 2019. Age-specific vaccination coverage for influenza (past year), pneumococcal (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV23] and/or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]), and live-attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccines (past 5 years) was reported. Logistic regression was used to investigate predictors of vaccination. Results:The study included 14,528 patients (RA: n = 6932; PsA: n = 4395; SLE: n = 1951; > 1 condition: n = 1250). Influenza vaccine coverage among patients with RA, PsA, and SLE was 45.1%, 36.2%, and 33.7%, respectively. For PPSV23, corresponding rates were 19.6%, 16.2%, and 12.6%, respectively. In the elderly population (≥ 65 years), 63.2% had influenza vaccine in the past year and 83.4% had a PPSV23 vaccine in the past 5 years or at age ≥ 65. For PCV13 and HZ, coverage in the overall study population was low at 4.8% and 3.6%, respectively. Central residence and treatment with corticosteroids and biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs within the past 5 years were significant predictors of vaccination coverage across all vaccines (P< 0.05). Other predictors varied by vaccine, including female sex (influenza, PPSV23, PCV13), age (influenza, PPSV23), chronic comorbidities (influenza, PPSV23, PCV13), shorter disease duration (PCV13), and high socioeconomic status (PCV13, HZ). Conclusion:This study demonstrated suboptimal coverage of influenza, pneumococcal, and HZ vaccination in patients with RA, PsA, and SLE, in particular among younger adults in Israel.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an infectious agent that causes both chickenpox and herpes zoster/shingles (HZ). This infection can take various clinical forms, result in permanent complications, and be a marker of immunosuppression, e.g. in the course of a neoplastic disease. The aim of this study is to analyze epidemiological trends in hospitalization and hospital mortality rate among HZ patients in Poland (2012-2021). Methods:Our study is a population-based, retrospective analysis of hospital discharge records of patients with HZ. Data were obtained from the National Institute of Public Health in Poland, and they covered the period from 2012 to 2021. All hospitalization records with primary or secondary ICD-10 B02 code diagnosis were included in the study. Results:We analyzed the total number of 23,432 hospital discharge records of HZ patients in 2012-2021. The study group consisted of 22,169 (94.6 %) hospitalization records of first-time diagnosis of HZ in hospitalized patients: 9,309 males (42 %) and 12,860 females (58 %). In this group, 70.3 % were patients over 60 years old. The mean and median age was 64 and 69 years, respectively. The mean annual first-time hospitalization rate for HZ was estimated to be 5.8 per 100,000 person-years (95 % CI: 4.8-6.7 per 100,000 person-years). The hospitalization rate for HZ was similar during 2012-2019. There was a significant decrease in hospitalizations in 2020-2021 in comparison with the previous years (R2= 0.42, p < 0.05). Women showed a higher hospitalization rate than men (p < 0.001). Urban residents had a higher hospitalization rate than rural residents (p < 0.001). In the analyzed period, 246 deaths were recorded (1.1 % of all hospitalized HZ patients) -119 males and 127 females. Conclusions:The HZ-related number of hospitalizations and mortality in Poland are relatively low, but HZ is still a significant health problem. Risk factors include female gender, older age and residence in urban areas.",

        "title": "Integrated Safety Update of Abrocitinib in 3802 Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: Data from More than 5200 Patient-Years with Up to 4 Years of Exposure",
        "abstract": "Background:Abrocitinib, an oral, once-daily, Janus kinase 1-selective inhibitor, is efficacious in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with a manageable long-term safety profile. Objective:We aimed to provide updated integrated long-term safety results for abrocitinib from available data accrued up to a maximum of almost 4 years in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from the JADE clinical development program. Methods:Analysis included 3802 patients (exposure: 5213.9 patient-years) from the phase II monotherapy study (NCT02780167) and the phase III studies JADE MONO-1 (NCT03349060), JADE MONO-2 (NCT03575871), JADE TEEN (NCT03796676), JADE COMPARE (NCT03720470), JADE DARE (NCT04345367; 200 mg only), JADE REGIMEN (NCT03627767), and JADE EXTEND (NCT03422822; data cutoff 25 September, 2021). Data from patients receiving one or more doses of abrocitinib 200 mg or 100 mg were pooled in a consistent-dose cohort (patients were allocated to receive the same abrocitinib dose throughout exposure in the qualifying parent study and/or long-term study) or a variable-dose cohort (patients received open-label abrocitinib 200 mg; responders were randomized to abrocitinib 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, and could then receive abrocitinib 200 mg plus topical corticosteroids as rescue therapy). Incidence rates of adverse events of special interest were assessed. Cox regression analysis of risk factors for herpes zoster and serious infections was performed. Results:Overall, this safety analysis of long-term data up to a maximum of ~ 4 years of abrocitinib exposure does not indicate any changes from the previously reported risk profile. The most frequent serious infections (per Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred term) with consistent-dose abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg were herpes zoster (0.5% and 0.2%), pneumonia (0.2% with either dose), and herpes simplex (0.1% with either dose). Risk factors for herpes zoster were a history of herpes zoster, abrocitinib 200-mg dose, age ≥ 65 years, absolute lymphocyte count < 1 × 103/mm3before the event, and residing in Asia. For serious infections, > 100 kg body weight was a risk factor. Incidence rate/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) with the consistent abrocitinib 200-mg and 100-mg dose combined was higher in older (aged ≥ 65 years) patients versus younger (aged 18 to < 65 years) patients for serious adverse events (17.6 [11.7‒25.4] vs 6.7 [5.8‒7.8]), malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (2.4 [0.6‒6.0] vs 0.1 [0.0‒0.4]), non-melanoma skin cancer (2.4 [0.6‒6.1] vs 0.2 [0.1‒0.4]), lymphopenia (3.5 [1.3‒7.6] vs 0.1 [0.0‒0.3]), and venous thromboembolism (1.7 [0.4‒5.1] vs 0.1 [0.0‒0.3]). Incident rate/100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) of non-melanoma skin cancer with the consistent abrocitinib 200-mg and 100-mg dose combined was higher in current/former smokers (0.9 [0.4‒1.6]) vs never-smokers (0.0 [0.0‒0.1]). Conclusions:This safety update showed a consistent profile for abrocitinib with no new safety signals and continues to support that abrocitinib has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Risk of specific adverse events was higher in certain patient populations, especially those aged ≥ 65 years.

Flanking the live attenuated vaccine (VZL) available, a newly recombinant vaccine (RZV) was recently introduced and approved for HZ prevention among adults. PLWH represents a population on which a particular attention should be applied, in order to guarantee the vaccine efficacy and safety. We performed a literature search in USNLM, PubMed, PubMed Central, PMC and Cochrane Library. From all the publications found eligible, data were extracted and processed per population, vaccine type, immunogenicity and ADRs. The review of the 13 included studies shows that both RZV and VZL are immunogenic and have an acceptable safety profile in adults and children living with HIV. However, given the lack of research available about vaccine efficacy in preventing VZV and HZ in PLWH, additional studies need to be performed, in order to achieve a full completeness of data.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) is one of the most common skin diseases caused by viruses. Facial HZ develops when the varicella-zoster virus affects the trigeminal nerve, and alveolar osteonecrosis is a rare complication. However, the exact pathogenesis of postherpetic alveolar osteonecrosis remains unclear. Case description:We encountered a patient who presented to the dermatology clinic with facial HZ and tooth exfoliation in the upper right jaw, and panoramic radiography revealed decreased bone density and poor alveolar socket healing in his right maxilla. Biopsy of the alveolar process revealed fragments of nonvital lamellar bone, which were devoid of osteoblasts and osteocytes and were surrounded by numerous neutrophils and bacterial aggregates. Thus, the diagnosis of alveolar osteonecrosis following facial HZ was confirmed. He then underwent resection of the osteonecrotic tissue. The pathological findings of postoperative tissue were similar to those of previous biopsies. Varicella-zoster virus and multiple types of bacteria were detected through next-generation sequencing, and the species of bacteria were consistent with the results of bacterial culture. Antibiotics and valaciclovir were administered during the perioperative period. The patient showed good recovery at the 9-month follow-up. Conclusions:The coexistence of bacterial and viral infection may play an important role in the pathogenesis of alveolar osteonecrosis following HZ. To our knowledge, we are the first to directly explore microbial pathogens in a case of postherpetic alveolar osteonecrosis through next-generation sequencing and bacterial culture. We recommend that oral examinations be carefully conducted for patients who are diagnosed with facial HZ, even if their facial rashes have faded away. We suggest that a prolonged and full-dose antiviral therapy course may be beneficial for the treatment of facial HZ with intraoral lesions. The implementation of dental preventive measures should be considered for patients with facial HZ. The application of antibiotics and excision of necrotic bone may reduce the abundance of bacteria in lesions and improve wound healing.",

        "abstract": "Background Herpes zoster (HZ) is a viral infection resulting from the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. The vaccination was proven to prevent herpes zoster and its complications for individuals over the age of 50 since they are more susceptible to herpes zoster infection. Therefore, it is essential to understand and acknowledge the herpes zoster infection and vaccine. This study aims to assess the level of knowledge and attitude towards herpes zoster and its vaccination among individuals at risk in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2023 and June 2023 among the general population in Saudi Arabia, using a self-administered online questionnaire adapted from a previous study after translating it into Arabic. Results A total of 1883 participants were included in this study, almost equally distributed across the five regions of Saudi Arabia. Females represented 62.4% (n=1175), and 56% (n=1062) of participants reported a positive history of chickenpox, while 3.6% (n=67) reported a history of herpes zoster. Furthermore, 78.9% (n=1486) have heard of herpes zoster, while 68.8% (n=1296) have at least one of the herpes zoster risk factors. Only 7.8% (n=147) had high knowledge about HZ, and only 3.1% (n=58) had adequate knowledge regarding the HZ vaccine. Conclusion Our study findings show that the general population of Saudi Arabia has inadequate knowledge about herpes zoster and its vaccine. For that reason, awareness and education programs targeting individuals at high risk of herpes zoster are required to enhance awareness and knowledge about herpes zoster and to improve their attitudes toward the herpes zoster vaccination.",

        "abstract": "The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human neurotropic herpes virus responsible for varicella and herpes zoster (HZ). Following primary infection in childhood, VZV manifests as varicella (chickenpox) and enters a period of latency within the dorsal root ganglion. A compromised cellular immune response due to aging or immunosuppression triggers viral reactivation and the development of HZ (shingles). Patients with autoimmune diseases have a higher risk of developing HZ owing to the immunodeficiency associated with the disease itself and/or the use of immunosuppressive agents. The introduction of new immunosuppressive agents with unique mechanisms has expanded the treatment options for autoimmune diseases but has also increased the risk of HZ. Specifically, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and anifrolumab have raised concerns regarding HZ. Despite treatment advances, a substantial number of patients suffer from complications such as postherpetic neuralgia for prolonged periods. The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is considered safe and effective even in immunocompromised patients. The widespread adoption of RZV may reduce the health and socioeconomic burdens of HZ patients. This review covers the link between VZV and autoimmune diseases, assesses the risk of HZ associated with immunosuppressant use, and discusses the benefits and risks of using RZV in patients with autoimmune diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the shape of the time-varying relationship between herpes zoster infection, nominally shingles, and the occurrence of stroke. Study design:Retrospective cohort study. Methods:Using the Italian Health Search Database, a cohort of patients aged ≥18 years who were registered between 2002 and 2021 was selected. In this cohort, a nested case-control analysis was used to model the time-varying distance (in months) between the dates of shingles and post-herpetic stroke, using a regression cubic spline, based on the odds of the occurrence of stroke compared with those without shingles. Results:The dataset comprised 42,513 cases (51.1% males; mean age [stanndard deviation {SD}]: 71.0 [11.8] years) and 425,124 related controls (51.1% males; mean age [SD]: 70.9 [12] years). In the first 12 months following shingles diagnosis, a rapid increase in the risk of stroke was observed, reaching an odds ratio of 1.31 (95% confidence interval: 1.21-1.41); subsequently, there was some risk reduction and a new symmetric increase within the first 4.2 years of follow-up, thus shaping a bimodal distribution. Then, a new increase in the stroke risk was reported, although less steep, which was followed by a regular risk reduction (still 10% higher compared with those without shingles), resulting in a right-skewed relationship between the time from the shingles diagnosis and the occurrence of stroke. This association was no longer statistically significant 13.1 years after shingles diagnosis. Conclusions:This study demonstrated that the risk of post-herpetic stroke has a short- and long-term association according to a risk continuum relationship. These findings confirm the relevance of vaccination coverage for herpes zoster.",

        "abstract": "Background:Reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus can cause herpes zoster (HZ) infection, and renal transplant recipients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy are particularly susceptible to this condition. This study aims to evaluate the potential increase in HZ incidence following influenza vaccination among this specific patient population. Methods:This study was a population-based, retrospective, self-controlled case series. Data were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database spanning the years 2008 to 2017. Patients diagnosed with HZ within a 6-month period before and after receiving the influenza vaccine were eligible for inclusion. Two distinct time intervals were defined for analysis: the initial 15 days and 30 days following vaccination were categorized as risk intervals, while all other periods served as control intervals. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were computed to compare HZ incidence during the risk intervals with that during the control intervals. Results:This study encompassed a cohort of 4,222 renal transplant recipients who had received the influenza vaccine. Among this group, 67 recipients were subsequently diagnosed with HZ. The IRR during both the initial 15 days (IRR = 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.23-1.89) and the first 30 days (IRR = 1.50; 95 % CI, 0.71-3.16) following influenza vaccination did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase when compared to the post-exposure observation times. Comparable results were also observed when comparing these IRR values to the pre-exposure observation times. The subgroup analysis, stratified by age, sex, and underlying medical conditions (including cancer and autoimmune diseases), revealed that the IRRs did not exhibit statistically significant differences. Conclusions:No significant association between the influenza vaccine and an elevated risk of HZ was detected. The administration of annual influenza vaccines appears to be a reasonable practice for renal transplant recipients.",

        "abstract": "Wolf isotopic response (WIR) is a phenomenon in which a second, unrelated skin disease arises at the same site as a previously healed dermatosis. WIR most commonly occurs in healed herpes zoster but has also been described in other conditions, such as herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and skin tumors. Acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) is characterized by transepidermal elimination of collagen bundles that lead to the development of ulcerative papules, which are often associated with systemic conditions such as diabetes or renal failure. This report documents a rare occurrence of APD after WIR and reviews related published works.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Preventing the development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), the most prevalent and severe complication of herpes zoster (HZ), is vital. Recently, it has been suggested that using temporary spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) for 10-14 days can improve HZ-associated pain (ZAP) and prevent PHN. However, myelitis complicates HZ. Permanent SCS has been successful in treating neuropathic pain induced by postoperative transverse myelitis of the spine that has not responded to traditional multidisciplinary treatment. However, it is unknown whether tSCS can reduce ZAP complicated with myelitis. Methodology:Between January 2020 and April 2022, all patients with HZ who visited our pain clinic with spinal cord edema and who underwent tSCS were enrolled in this study; their medical records were retrospectively examined. Pain intensity was assessed at baseline (before initiating interventional procedures), just before tSCS, after tSCS removal, and one and three months after tSCS. Results:Twelve patients were enrolled. The mean Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was 7.9 ± 1.6 at baseline (before interventional procedures), 6.8 ± 2.2 before tSCS (after interventional procedures), and 3.5 ± 2.4 after tSCS. Compared with before tSCS, the mean NRS decreased to 3.3 ± 2.3 after tSCS (P= 0.0004). The mean NRS changes with interventional procedures before and after tSCS were -1.2 ± 2.2 (P= 0.0945) and 3.3 ± 2.3 (P= 0.0004), respectively; the change after tSCS was significantly higher (between-group difference: -2.1 ± 3.7;P= 0.0324). Conclusions:Temporary SCS alleviated pain in cases of shingles with myelitis refractory to interventional therapy. Even in cases with myelitis, tSCS for ZAP remains an effective way to prevent PHN.",

However, evidence regarding vaccine uptake among patients with COPD is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate trends in herpes zoster vaccination and characteristics associated with vaccination among US older adults with COPD. Methods:Data from the 2008 to 2022 National Health Interview Survey were used. Participants aged ≥50 years were included. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to analyze trends in herpes zoster vaccination. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with vaccination. Results:From 2008 to 2022, an increasing trend in herpes zoster vaccination was observed (average annual percent change = 15.10, P < .01). This increasing trend was also observed when stratified by age groups. Disparities in vaccination were found across several factors, including age, sex, race or ethnicity, region, educational level, health insurance, income, smoking status, perceived health status, and flu and pneumococcal vaccination. Conclusions:There has been an upward trend in herpes zoster vaccination over the past 15 years among older adults with COPD. Disparities across several characteristics existed, underscoring the necessity for targeted policies and interventions to promote equity in vaccination.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may trigger the reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus and may be a risk factor for herpes zoster (HZ). However, the causal relationship between COVID-19 and varicella-zoster infections remains controversial. This study aimed to estimate the causal inferences between COVID-19 and HZ. Methods:This study used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. The inverse variance-weighted method was used as the primary method and sensitivity analyses were conducted, including the MR-Egger regression, weighted median and weighted mode. We searched at https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/ using the keywords \"COVID-19\" for exposure data and \"zoster\" for outcome datasets. Results:We got 26 COVID-19 datasets and five zoster datasets. We used 26 COVID-19 datasets as exposure data corresponding to each zoster dataset for the MR analysis. There were nine datasets of COVID-19 where the number of SNPs was fewer than three in the MR analysis of the risk of HZ, varicella zoster virus (VZV) glycoprotein E and I antibody levels, anti-VZV IgG seropositivity, and post-zoster neuralgia. In addition, there were 10 datasets of COVID-19 where the number of SNPs was less than three in the MR analysis of anti-VZV IgG levels. The results of the MR analysis showed that all p-values were greater than 0.05. Sensitivity analysis revealed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy in most two sample MR analyses. Conclusion:Our results indicate that there is no causal relationship between COVID-19 and varicella-zoster infection, HZ progression, and postherpetic neuralgia.",

This study used data covering 2 million people in Taiwan in 2000, which were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database. The cohort study observed aged 20-100 years with obesity from 2000 to 2017 (tracking to 2018). Obesity was indicated by the presence of two or more outpatient diagnoses or at least one admission record. And, obesity was categorized into non-morbid obesity and morbid obesity. Patients with HZ before the index date were excluded. The obesity cohort and control cohort were matched 1:1 according to age, sex, comorbidities, and index year. There were 18,855 patients in both the obesity and control cohorts. The obesity cohort [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.09] had a higher risk of HZ than the control cohort. Further analysis, the morbid obesity group (aHR 1.47), had a significantly higher risk of HZ than the non-morbid obesity group. Among the patients without any comorbidities, the patients with obesity had a significantly higher risk of developing HZ than the patients without obesity (aHR 1.18). Obese patients are at a higher risk of HZ development, especially in the patients with morbid obesity. Weight reduction is critical for preventing the onset of chronic diseases and decreasing the risk of HZ in patients with obesity.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) after COVID-19 vaccination has been reported in numerous case studies. However, no large-scale epidemiologic studies have been conducted to date. The purpose of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 vaccination is associated with an increased risk of HZO. Design:Retrospective before-and-after risk interval analysis. Methods:RESULTS: In total, 1,959,157 patients received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine during the study period and met eligibility criteria. A total of 80 individuals without a prior history of HZO were included in the analysis because they developed HZO in the risk or control period. Patients had a mean age of 54.0 years (SD = 12.3 years). There were 45 cases of HZO in the risk interval after COVID-19 vaccination. There was not an increased risk of HZO after vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.49-1.69, P = .74), mRNA-1273 (IRR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.36-1.54, P = .42), or Ad26.COV2.S (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.07-2.56, P = .42). Conclusions:This study found no evidence of increased risk of HZO after COVID-19 vaccination, providing reassurance for patients and providers who may be concerned about the safety profile of the COVID-19 vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:We aimed to compare the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) in adults with and without laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods:This retrospective dynamic cohort study analyzed data from a public healthcare database in Spain between November 2020 and October 2021. The main outcome was incident cases of HZ in individuals ≥18-year-old. Relative risk (RR) of HZ in SARS-CoV-2-confirmed versus SARS-CoV-2-free individuals was estimated by a multivariable negative binomial regression adjusted by age, sex, and comorbidities. Results:Data from 4,085,590 adults were analyzed. The overall HZ incidence rate in adults was 5.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.66-5.85) cases per 1000 person-years. Individuals ≥18-year-old with SARS-CoV-2-confirmed infection had a 19% higher risk of developing HZ versus SARS-CoV-2-free ≥18-year-olds (adjusted RR = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.29); this percentage was 16% (adjusted RR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.29) in ≥50-year-olds. Severe (hospitalized) cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection had a 64% (if ≥18 years old) or 44% (if ≥50 years old) higher risk of HZ versus nonhospitalized cases. Conclusion:These results support an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HZ, with a greater HZ risk in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

        "abstract": "Background:Vaccination is the most effective strategy for preventing infectious diseases and related complications, and proving its efficacy is crucial for its success and adherence, especially for newly introduced vaccines, such as adjuvanted recombinant herpes zoster virus vaccination (RZV). In this observational real-life study, we recorded adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs) after RZV administration in frail populations. Methods:A total of 271 subjects underwent RZV at Vaccination Center, University Hospital \"San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d'Aragona\", Salerno, Italy. Most subjects were solid organ transplant recipients (kidney, 77.1%; liver, 4.8%). Demographics, clinical data, and AEFIs (type, duration, and medications used) were recorded. Results:Overall, 37% of participants reported at least one AEFI following the first dose, predominantly pain at the injection site (60%), while 41% did so after the second dose (pain at the injection site in 62% of cases). Medications were more frequently used for AEFI treatment after the second dose (28%) rather than after the first dose (13%) (p= 0.01). After stratification by sex, females experienced AEFIs more frequently than males, particularly local skin reactions. Conclusions:Our study added evidence of safety and tolerability of the adjuvanted recombinant RZV in frail adults.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ), commonly known as shingles, is a painful blistering rash in dermatomal distribution, caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that was acquired during a primary varicella infection. While commonly afflicting adults, cases of HZ in paediatric patients are infrequently reported. Such cases are predominantly reported in children who have had prior exposure to VZV, either during pregnancy, early childhood or have been vaccinated with live attenuated VZV. This report presents the first known case to our knowledge of HZ as the initial manifestation of a VZV infection in an immunocompetent toddler in the UK. The report details the chronology of the infection event and discusses the clinical context behind HZ presentations in paediatrics globally. It provides a compelling illustration of the uncommon presentation of VZV infection in an immunocompetent child devoid of antecedent virus exposure, thus meriting acknowledgement and potentially further investigation as to the cause.",

        "abstract": "Background:Chronic conditions (CCs) may increase the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection, leading to a greater healthcare burden in these individuals compared to those without CCs. It is therefore clinically important to quantify HZ disease burden in individuals with and without CCs, given the rapidly aging population in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Methods:This retrospective cohort study examines the trends in incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in individuals aged ≥18 years with CCs, using the National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) database from 2010 to 2019. These patients were stratified by age group, sex, HZ complications, and CCs. The annual average number of HZ patients, IRs, and IRRs were calculated for individuals with and without CCs. Results:In total, 729 347 patients with HZ were eligible for the study. HZ IRs were highest in patients with diabetes, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, asthma, and chronic liver disease, with HZ IRRs following a similar trend. Overall, HZ IRs generally increased with age, typically peaking at 60-64 or 65-69 years, and were similar for females and males. HZ IRs were highest among patients without complications, followed by HZ with other, cutaneous, ocular, and neurologic complications across all CCs. For each of the CCs, HZ IRs were consistently higher than those of the non-CC population regardless of sex. Conclusions:The findings of this study reiterate the importance of HZ prevention for healthy aging, especially for CC populations at increased risk of HZ in the ROK.",

        "abstract": "The data on the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) in spondyloarthropathy (SpA) patients are sparse, especially regarding its association with the novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and immunosuppressants. We aimed to evaluate whether SpA diagnosis and/or immunosuppressant use affect HZ risk and the influence of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed the association between SpA (psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS)) diagnoses and HZ in a large population database with patients matched by age and sex to controls. We also assessed the association between the COVID-19 vaccine and new-onset HZ using two nested case-control studies, identifying all new HZ cases diagnosed from 1 January-31 December 2021 within the SpA and general population cohorts, matched randomly by sex, age and HZ index date to controls without HZ. Exposure to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was ascertained in the 6 weeks prior to the index date both in cases and controls. In our results, the incidence rate of HZ was higher in PsA patients vs. the general population, at 1.03 vs. 0.64 per 100 person-years, respectively (adjusted HR = 1.55; 95%CI, 1.19-2.02). Within the SpA group, Jak-I treatment was associated with a higher risk of developing new-onset HZ (adjusted OR = 3.79; 1.15-12.5). Multivariable conditional logistic regression models we used showed no association between COVID-19 vaccination and new-onset HZ among the SpA patients (OR = 1.46; 0.68-3.14).",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ), or shingles, is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which remains latent in the sensory ganglia until immunity wanes with age. The representative HZ vaccine, Shingrix is efficacious but causes side effects due to vaccine adjuvants. Therefore, the development of highly efficacious vaccines with minimal side effects is required. We developed chimeric adenovirus vector (ChimAd)-based HZ vaccine candidates encoding the VZV glycoprotein E (gE). These candidates include ChimAd-tPAgE, in which the signal peptide is replaced with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and ChimAd-WTgE, which retains the original signal peptide. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with VZV-vaccine candidates, and cellular and humoral immune responses were evaluated using interferon-γ ELISPOT and ELISA. The ChimAd-based HZ vaccines induced high levels of gE-specific antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. ChimAd-tPAgE (optimal dose: 1 × 107IFU) elicited a more robust gE-specific T-cell response than Shingrix and Zostavax, showing potential as HZ prophylactic vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Disseminated herpes zoster (DHZ) is a severe infection associated with high incidences and mortality rates in immunocompromised patients. Although studies have shown its occurrence in immunocompetent patients, its epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment outcomes in this cohort remain unknown. Thus, this study aimed to examine the clinical presentation, treatment, complications, and outcomes of DHZ in immunocompetent patients and compare these findings with previous studies. Methods:We included 20 immunocompetent patients of DHZ at our institution and reviewed 42 previously published cases. We then investigated the clinical features, predisposing factors, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes of all cases including in-hospital mortality, neurological dysfunction at discharge, and postherpetic neuralgia. We compared DHZ-immunocompetent patients to DHZ-immunocompromised patients. Results:Patients had a median age of 71.5 years and were predominantly male. The trigeminal area was the most common site of initial rash, with a mean dissemination time of 6.5 days. Pain was the most common symptom, followed by fever (approximately 40 % of cases); acyclovir was the most used treatment. Additionally, the in-hospital mortality was 0 %, neuropathy at discharge was observed in approximately 10 % of patients, and postherpetic neuralgia was present in approximately 40 % of patients. In the immunocompromised cases, the mortality rate was 12 %, which was higher than in our cases; however, the rates of neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia were lower. Conclusions:This study provides new insights into the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of DHZ cases in immunocompetent patients, highlighting its tendency for residual neurological damage despite having low mortality rates.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of Herpes Zoster (HZ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), and to predict potential risk factors for HZ development.Methods: We retrospectively analysed medical records from RA patients at our rheumatology unit who met the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA and were receiving JAKi. The incidence and course of HZ were assessed through chart review and supplementary phone interviews.Results: A total of 198 JAKi-treated patients were monitored for an average of 18.5 months. Nine subjects experienced HZ, resulting in an incidence of 2.95 per 100 patient-years. No demographic or treatment-related differences were found among patients who developed HZ and those who did not. Disease duration (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.12), time on JAKi treatment (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.009-1.073), higher disease activity at JAKi initiation (OR: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.07-16.17), and at 3-month follow-up (OR: 6.0, 95% CI: 1.35-26.60) were identified as predictors of HZ occurrence. Thirty-six patients received vaccination against HZ, and none reported adverse reactions or flare-ups during a mean follow-up of 9.6 months.Conclusions: The incidence of HZ aligns with published data, suggesting that disease and treatment duration, as well as disease activity, are significant predictors of HZ in RA patients on JAKi therapy. Vaccination against HZ proved to be safe and effective, underscoring its potential protective value in this patient population.",

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease that can also impair the immune system.6-8. Case presentation:The authors present the case of a 65-year-old male with COPD who developed HZ. The patient was initially admitted to the hospital for an acute exacerbation of COPD. After his condition stabilized, he developed vesicular rashes on the medial aspect of his left leg. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of HZ. Clinical discussion:This case report provides further evidence that HZ can be induced in patients who are undergoing treatment for COPD. The authors recommend that COPD patients be vaccinated against HZ to prevent this complication. Conclusion:HZ can develop in COPD patients, mainly using inhaled steroids. Compliance to medication should be monitored, on the other hand zoster vaccination should be provided to prevent it and its foremost complication which includes secondary bacterial infection, post-herpetic neuralgia, scarring, nerve palsy and encephalitis in case with disseminated zoster.",

        "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious human herpes virus responsible for causing chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster). Despite the approval of a highly effective vaccine, Shingrix®, the global incidence of herpes zoster is increasing and the economic burden to the health care system and society are substantial due to significant loss of productivity and health complications, particularly among elderly and immunocompromised individuals. This is primarily because access to the vaccines remains mostly limited to countries within developed economies, such as USA and Canada. Therefore, similarly effective vaccines against VZV that are more accessible to the rest-of-the-world are necessary. In this study, we aimed to evaluate immunogenicity and memory response induced by three mRNA-LNP-based vaccine candidates targeting VZV's surface glycoprotein E (gE). C57BL/6 mice were immunized with each candidate vaccine, and humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed. Our results demonstrate that the mRNA-LNP-based vaccine candidates elicited robust and durable humoral responses specific to the gE antigen. Notably, mice vaccinated with the mRNA-LNP vaccines exhibited significantly higher antigen-specific T-cell cytokine production compared to the group receiving Shingrix®, the current standard of care vaccine. Additionally, mRNA-LNP vaccines induced long-lasting memory response, as evidenced by detection of persistent gE-specific Long-Lived Plasma Cells (LLPCs) and memory T cells four months after final immunization. These findings underscore the potential of our mRNA-LNP-based vaccine candidates in generating potent immune responses against VZV, offering promising prospects for their clinical development as an effective prophylactic vaccine against herpes zoster.",

        "abstract": "Background:Health-seeking behavior towards herpes zoster is vital to find an appropriate remedy for patients and utilization of timely healthcare services can have an impact on good health outcomes. The study aimed to assess the health-seeking behavior and determinants among Herpes Zoster patients in public hospitals, South Wollo, Ethiopia. Method:A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September 1, 2022, to November 30, 2022. The simple random sampling technique was used to select 419 participants. Pretested, structured questionnaires and patient interviews were used to collect the data. The bivariable analysis was done and variables with p-value <0.25 were further examined using a multivariable logistic regression model. AOR with a 95 % CI and a P-value <0.05 at a 5 % level of significance were considered. Results:About 55.6 % of patients had poor health-seeking behavior towards herpes zoster, with a response rate of 99.1 %. Distance from health facilities (AOR = 4.9; 95 % CI: 1.33-10.35), being rural residence (AOR = 0.3; 95 % CI: 0.17-0.40), being illiterate (AOR = 5.9; 95 % CI: 3.40-10.32), poor self-care adherence (AOR = 1.8; 95 % CI = 1.14-3.07), moderate depression (AOR = 7.3; 95 % CI: 4.10-11.50), moderate (AOR = 0.3; 95 % CI: 0.10-0.70) and severe anxiety (AOR = 0.1; 95 % CI: 0.01-0.63), and duration more than seven days of herpes zoster (AOR = 3.1; 95 % CI = 1.42-6.97) were statistically significant. Conclusion:Nearly half of the study participants had poor health-seeking behavior. Being a rural resident and illiterate, poor self-care adherence, moderate and severe anxiety, moderate depression, and duration of more than 7 days were significantly associated. with health-seeking behavior towards Herpes Zoster. Proper guidance, psychological support, and awareness creation about Herpes Zoster severity and complications.",

        "abstract": "Objective:The association between herpes zoster (HZ) and stroke has been the subject of much previous research. Nevertheless, the connection remains ambiguous. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation study was conducted to explore the potential causal link between HZ and ischaemic stroke, including its subtypes. Methods:For our MR analysis, we identified genetic instrumental variables related to both HZ and stroke by screening two prominent publicly accessible genome-wide association study databases. The primary approach involved using the inverse variance weighting method. To supplement this, we also employed methods such as MR-Egger regression, the weighted median approach, simple and weighted models. Lastly, to ascertain the stability and reliability of the results, we conducted tests for heterogeneity detection, horizontal pleiotropy assessment, and a leave-one-out analysis. Results:The genetically predicted HZ did not indicate an association with stroke risk ([OR] 1.041; 95% [CI] 0.958-1.131;p= 0.336). This lack of association also held true for different subtypes of stroke: ischaemic stroke (OR = 1.047, 95% CI = 0.955-1.148,p= 0.323), large vessel stroke (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.90-1.41,p= 0.272), cardioembolic stroke (OR = 1.020, 95% CI = 0.859-1.211,p= 0.816), small vessel stroke (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.93-1.40,p= 0.195), and lacunar stroke (OR = 1.195, 95% CI = 0.967-1.476,p= 0.097). Conclusion:This MR study showed that not uncover a causal link between herpes zoster and ischaemic stroke. Additional research will be necessary in the future to shed light on the fundamental mechanisms involved.",

HSV-1 and HSV-2 are fairly common and result in oral and genital lesions. Recurrent infections of herpes include lesions on the lips resulting in pain and possibly societal stigma, making adequate treatment of these conditions crucial. VZV is the cause of chicken pox and shingles. Acyclovir and other nucleoside analogues have been the gold standard of treatment for HSV and VZV, but newer, more effective treatments are being developed, which is beneficial regarding the issue of resistance to standard antivirals. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is also a DNA virus with different subtypes that result in four common oral benign lesions. The significance and treatments of HSV, VZV, and HPV are discussed, along with certain developing treatments of herpes labialis (HSV).",

The patient was presented with acute renal failure associated with intravenous acyclovir administration for its management. A 50 years old man visited the hospital with rashes on his back. The serum sample was positive for anti-VZV IgM via Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and vesicular swab for VZV via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analysis identified it as M2-genotype. Patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir administration, which led to acute renal failure. Later with shift to oral acyclovir, renal functions were restored. Elderly patients with reactivation of VZV in Pakistan are at risk to contract herpes zoster. Acyclovir is drug of choice via intravenous route was found to be nephrotoxic, however oral acyclovir was safe and effective. This is first report on pathogenic VZV genotype from Pakistan and is presented to highlight that the herpes zoster cases of elderly patients' treatment option need to be revisited.",

        "abstract": "This population-based study investigated the risk of having had prior herpes zoster within five years preceding a diagnosis of head and neck cancer. We conducted a case-control study that included 9,191 patients with a diagnosis of head and neck cancer in Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2010 and 36,764 matched controls. We assessed the odds of patients with head and neck cancer having had a diagnosis of herpes zoster during the five years preceding head and neck cancer using multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of prior herpes zoster among the total sample was 4.6%, 7.9% and 3.8% among patients with and without head and neck cancer, respectively (p < 0.001). The odds ratio of herpes zoster among the head and neck cancer- versus control group was 2.198 (95% CI = 2.001 ~ 2.415) after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use disorder, HPV infection, and alcohol dependence syndrome. Statistically significant excess odds were observed for all specific subtypes of head and neck cancer except for sinonasal cancer. Herpes zoster infection within the 5 years preceding a diagnosis of head and neck cancer may be a harbinger of developing head and neck cancer.",

The patient developed burning swollen lesions on the left forehead four days after receiving BTX injections. Physical examination revealed papules and erosions in a dermatomal distribution. He was diagnosed with HZ and promptly treated with oral acyclovir. The lesions resolved within two weeks without complications. Previous literature reports a few similar HZ outbreaks following aesthetic treatments with BTX injections. The exact mechanism triggering varicella reactivation in these cases remains unclear. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of HZ are crucial in order to minimize outbreak duration and reduce complications. Physicians should maintain awareness of HZ as a potential complication following BTX injections.",

        "abstract": "A middle-aged gentleman, presented to our outpatient department with painful skin lesions suggestive of disseminated herpes zoster. Further examination revealed bilateral cerebellar signs. He had a history of receiving a third dose of AZD1222 vaccine fourteen days prior to the onset of skin lesions but had no other significant medical history. The patient was also evaluated for retroviral infection and other immunodeficient states, workup for which were negative. The patient was initially treated with intravenous acyclovir 7.5 mg/kg/q8H; however, the patient developed varicella encephalitis on treatment, which was followed by pneumonia and haemorrhagic cystitis. Subsequently, treatment was started with acyclovir 10 mg/kg/q8H for 14 days, followed by valacyclovir for eight days, following which there was near-complete resolution of symptoms with the persistence of minimal rigidity. Although there have been several reports of herpes zoster following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we found few reports of varicella zoster with systemic manifestations following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccination. This case highlights the importance of considering varicella zoster reactivation in a patient presenting with encephalitis or pneumonia post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",

        "abstract": "For herpes zoster (HZ) infection, early diagnosis and treatment are important in order to shorten the course of the disease and reduce sequelae, however, there is a lack of non-invasive diagnostic methods. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a non-invasive technique often used to diagnose dyspigmented dermatosis, skin tumours, human papillomavirus infectious dermatosis, etc. To evaluate the clinical value of RCM for the early diagnosis of HZ. We collected RCM images from 30 HZ patients with typical vesicles in order to analyse their features. We then utilized RCM to analyse early lesions of another 12 HZ patients, who presented with localized erythema or papules, but not typical vesicles. In addition, we recruited one patient with HZ and observed the lesions over 14 days also using RCM. RCM images showed that the typical lesions of HZ mainly involved oedema of the spinous layer, intraepidermal blister formation, ballooning multinucleated giant (BMG) cells, and dermal papillary oedema. Among them, BMG cells were of specific diagnostic value. Early lesions of HZ patients without typical vesicles showed BMG cells under RCM. A few BMG cells were observed during the early stage of HZ. However, the number of BMG cells increased significantly as typical clustered blisters gradually appeared in the lesions. With the regression of the lesions, the number of BMG cells decreased gradually. RCM, with the advantages of being non-invasive, rapid, and convenient, has an important role in monitoring the evolution of HZ.",

        "abstract": "Background and objectives:Herpes zoster, or shingles, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which initially presents as chickenpox in children. VZV is a global health concern, especially in winter and spring, affecting 10-20% of adults over 50 and posing a 30% risk for the general population. This study used PCR to detect VZV, confirming results with duplicated DNA samples and identifying 234 bp fragments by targeting the gpB gene. Materials and methods:This study examined 50 herpes zoster cases from October 2020 to April 2021, involving 30 males and 20 females aged 10 to 90, diagnosed by dermatologists. Data were collected via a questionnaire. PCR detected VZV by amplifying the gpB and MCP genes from skin lesion samples. Six positive 234-bp PCR products were sequenced at Macrogen Inc. in Seoul, South Korea. Results:Six DNA samples with 234 bp amplicons were sequenced, showing 99-100% similarity to human alpha herpesvirus sequences in the gpB gene. NCBI BLAST matched these sequences to a reference (GenBank acc. MT370830.1), assigning accession numbers LC642111, LC642112, and LC642113. Eight nucleic acid substitutions caused amino acid changes in the gpB protein: isoleucine to threonine, serine to isoleucine, and threonine to Proline. These variants were deposited in NCBI GenBank as gpB3 samples. Conclusion:The study found high sequence similarity to known VZV sequences, identifying six nucleic acid variations and eight SNPs. Notable amino acid changes in the gpB protein were deposited in NCBI GenBank as the gpB3 sample.",

        "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of infection. Their risk of presenting herpes zoster (HZ) is 1.5-2 times higher than immunocompetent individuals and disseminated presentation is more frequent. Our aim was to analyze the prevalence and general features of HZ in RA patients.Methods: This was a prospective study of 392 RA patients included in the vaccination program of our hospital between 2011 and 2016, and follow-up continued until December 2020. A diagnosis of HZ was made according to clinical manifestations: skin rash, blisters, paresthesia, and local pain in one or more dermatomes.Results: We studied 392 participants (309 women/83 men), mean age 59 ± 13 years. Every patient was followed-up over a mean period of 137 ± 110 months (range: 42 months-42 years). HZ infection was observed in 30 of 392 (25 women/5 men) patients, age (mean ± SD) 64.7 ± 11.8 years. Prevalence was 7.65% in this period and the incidence rate was 13.22/1000 patients/year. Three patients had facial involvement, one had optic involvement, and one patient presented disseminated HZ. Seven patients presented post herpetic neuralgia treated with gabapentinoids. The main features of RA of these 30 patients were: positive RF (n = 17; 56.6%), positive anti-CCP (n = 13; 43.3%), and erosive disease (n = 10; 33.3%). At HZ infection, the treatments were glucocorticoids (n = 19; 63.3%), conventional DMARDs (n = 15; 50%), biological DMARDs (n = 15; 50%), tofacitinib (n = 2; 6.6%), and upadacitinib (n = 1; 3.3%).Conclusions: HZ is a relatively frequent viral complication in RA patients. In our series, one patient presented disseminated HZ and nearly 25% of patients had post-herpetic neuralgia. Including a HZ vaccine in our vaccination program for RA patients may be beneficial.",

        "abstract": "Background:Celiac Disease (CD) is associated with increased susceptibility to certain bacterial and viral infections. Herpes zoster (HZ) is a viral infection that can be prevented by immunization. In the US, the vaccine is recommended for adults ≥ 50 or ≥ 19 with certain at-risk conditions, not including CD. Aims:We aimed to determine if adult patients aged < 50 or ≥ 50 years with CD had a higher risk of developing HZ. Methods:We designed a retrospective cohort study. CD was defined as patients with the ICD-10 code for CD and positive Celiac serology. Patients with negative serology and lacking CD ICD-10 codes served as controls. Patients who had HZ before CD diagnosis were excluded. We formed two sub-cohorts, those aged < 50 (cohort 1) and aged ≥ 50 years (cohort 2), and evaluated HZ infection at 10-year follow-up. To account for confounding variables, we performed 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Results:Following PSM, cohort 1 had 6,826 CD patients, and cohort 2 had 5,337 CD patients and respective matched controls. After ten years of follow-up, in cohort 1, 62 CD patients developed HZ versus 57 controls, RR: 1.09 (CI: 0.76-1.56, p-value = 0.64). In cohort 2, 200 CD patients developed HZ versus 159 controls, RR: 1.2 (CI: 1.02-1.54, p-value = 0.03). Conclusion:There was no significant difference in the likelihood of getting HZ in CD patients < 50, although CD patients ≥ 50 had a modestly increased risk. Our findings do not support routine early vaccination for HZ in CD, and the vaccine should be offered at age 50.",

        "abstract": "Sleep problems was associated with increased risk for herpes zoster (HZ). This study examined subjects with insomnia or a combination of insomnia and depression and their risk of HZ. This retrospective cohort study included a total of 47,256 participants, with a control comprising 31,504 age- and sex-matched patients. Clinical data from 2000 to 2013 in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were used for analysis. Insomnia, depression, and HZ were defined according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Subjects with insomnia had a significantly higher incidence of HZ (2.77 per 1000 person-years) than the controls (1.81 per 1000 person-years) as well as a higher risk of developing HZ (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-1.93). Results shown subjects with insomnia durations of < 4 years, 4-6 years, and > 6 years had a significantly higher risk of HZ compared with the controls (AHR: 6.69, 95% CI 4.44-9.39; AHR: 4.42, 95% CI 3.07-6.36; AHR:1.38, 95% CI 1.14-1.87, respectively). We found a significantly higher risk of HZ in subjects with both insomnia and depression (AHR = 4.95; 95% CI = 3.99-7.02) than in those without related conditions. Patients with insomnia, and even more so those with comorbid depression, had a higher risk of developing HZ. This indicates a joint effect of insomnia and depression on HZ.",

        "abstract": "Objective This study clarified a variety of neurological phenotypes associated with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. Methods This retrospective single-center study included consecutive patients with herpes zoster accompanied by neurological disturbances from April 2016 to September 2022. A comparative analysis was performed to examine whether or not the neurological phenotype and severity were associated with the distribution of herpes zoster, clinical and laboratory findings, and treatments. Results Twenty-six patients with a median age of 74 years old were enrolled. None of the patients had been vaccinated against herpes zoster. Of the 26 patients, 14 (54%) developed monoparesis, 5 (19%) developed meningitis, 5 (19%) developed encephalitis, 1 (4%) developed paraplegia, and 1 (4%) developed bladder and rectal problems. Monoparesis of the upper limb is associated with herpes zoster involving the cervical and thoracic dermatomes, whereas meningitis and encephalitis often occur in patients with herpes zoster in the trigeminal and thoracic dermatomes. Neurological disability was generally severe [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≥3] on admission [17 of 26 (65%) patients]. Good recovery after admission was associated with a lower mRS value before the onset of neurological disability, clinical meningitis, and elevated cell counts and protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Good recoveries were observed in patients with herpes zoster in the trigeminal or thoracic dermatomes more frequently than in other dermatomes. Conclusion This study revealed that VZV-related neurological complications are heterogeneous, commonly leading to severe disability and poor outcomes, and that neurological phenotypes and outcomes are related to the distribution of herpes zoster.",

        "abstract": "Background:Tofacitinib is one of the Janus kinase inhibitors approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The major adverse event of this drug is herpes zoster, which can lead to death in severe cases. The risk of herpes zoster has been studied at 10 mg/day of tofacitinib; however, 5 mg/day, which is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease, is unclear. Objective:To investigate whether 5 mg/day of tofacitinib reduced the risk of herpes zoster compared with 10 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Methods:We analyzed the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report Data (JADER) database and compared the frequency of herpes zoster in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with tofacitinib 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for herpes zoster in tofacitinib users. Results:A total of 812 tofacitinib users with rheumatoid arthritis were identified, including 131 with herpes zoster. Disproportionality for herpes zoster was observed between 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day (reporting odds ratio (OR): 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47-0.98, P = 0.045). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of herpes zoster was significantly increased in female patients (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.12-3.12, P = 0.016) and methotrexate users (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.12-2.54, P = 0.013) and significantly decreased with tofacitinib 5 mg/day compared with 10 mg/day (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.40-0.96, P = 0.032). Conclusion:We suggest that tofacitinib 5 mg/day may decrease the risk of herpes zoster compared with 10 mg/day in rheumatoid arthritis patients.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Herpes zoster (HZ) substantially affects patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), both in the acute phase and also in those developing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Building upon a previous qualitative concept elicitation study in Canada, we adopted a similar approach to further understand the patient experience of HZ/PHN in Argentina and impact on quality of life and qualitatively validate the previously published conceptual model for Argentina. Methods:(1) Comprehensive literature review of HZ impact on HRQoL in Latin America. (2) Qualitative concept elicitation interviews with participants aged ≥50 years with acute HZ or PHN. Verbatim interview transcripts underwent thematic and content analysis related to symptoms and impacts. Results:Studies from the literature (n = 6) identified 5 dimensions of HZ impact on HRQoL: pain management, disease management, family life, work, and emotional impact. A total of 10 participants were interviewed (5 acute HZ and 5 with PHN) with a mean age of 68.5 years (range 50-77 years) and 60% female. All participants reported rash and pain (some reporting a migratory element), fatigue (7 of 10), and itchiness (4 of 10). HRQoL domains most commonly affected were activities of daily living (9 of 10), emotional functioning (8 of 10), physical functioning (8 of 10), and sleep (7 of 10). Emergent themes on disease management included the need for greater public disease awareness/education, participants with PHN seeking alternative/traditional medical therapies. Conclusions:This study qualitatively validates the previously reported HRQoL conceptual framework. HZ symptoms, especially acute and chronic pain, substantially impair various aspects of HRQoL, prompting some participants to seek out alternative medical treatments.",

        "abstract": "Background:Recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV] reduces the short-term risk of herpes zoster [HZ] in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. However, there is lack of data regarding the long-term effectiveness in this population. Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted in adults ≥50 years old using TriNetX database between patients with IBD who received two doses of RZV [IBD-RZV cohort] and patients who did not receive RZV [IBD control cohort]. The primary outcome was risk of incident HZ. One-to-one propensity score matching was performed for demographic parameters, comorbid conditions, and IBD medications. Risk was expressed as adjusted odds ratio [aOR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. Results:The IBD-RZV cohort [n = 5489; mean age 63.2 ± 9.1 years; 57.2% females] was identified with a mean follow-up of 900.9 days. IBD-RZV cohort had a lower risk of HZ [aOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32-0.62] compared with IBD control cohort. The risk of HZ was lower in patients aged 50-65 years [aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.25-0.68] and patients >65 years [aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96]. There was a lower risk of HZ in patients with ulcerative colitis [aOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27-0.63] and Crohn's disease [aOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.74] in the IBD-RZV cohort compared with IBD control cohort. Conclusion:RZV is associated with a lower long-term risk of HZ in patients ≥50 years old with IBD. Given the widespread availability and safety of RZV, more effective vaccination strategies are needed to improve RZV use in this high-risk population.",

        "abstract": "Background:The opioid overdose epidemic has resulted in hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths in the United States (US). One indication for opioids is herpes zoster (HZ)-a common painful condition with an estimated 1 million cases occurring annually in the US. Objective:We aimed to characterize prescription opioid claims and trends among patients with HZ who were previously opioid naive. Design:We used a cohort study involving three insurance claims databases in the US. We included all beneficiaries 18-64 years (commercial and Medicaid) and beneficiaries 65 years and older (Medicare) who were diagnosed with incident HZ during 2007-2021. We determined the proportion of opioid-naive patients with HZ who filled an opioid prescription within 30 days and 180 days following HZ diagnosis. We also examined trends over the study period, proportion receiving moderate, high dosages (50-89 morphine milligram equivalent [MME], and ≥90 MME per day), and long-term receipt. Results:Among all three insurance databases, 2,595,837 patients had an incident episode of HZ and were opioid naive during the prior 6 months. Within 30 days following HZ, 623,515 (24 percent) filled a prescription for an opioid. The percentage with an opioid claim declined during 2007-2021 for all groups; 65 percent for commercially insured patients, 51 percent for Medicaid-insured patients, and 60 percent for Medicare-insured patients. Approximately 8-15 percent of all beneficiaries received moderate and 2-6 percent received high dosage opioids. Long-term prescription opioid use of at least 6 months was found in 7-12 percent of the patients. Conclusions:Continuing trends in judicious opioid prescribing as well as use of recommended HZ vaccines may decrease opioid prescriptions for HZ.",

        "abstract": "Shingles is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and manifests as painful skin rashes. While the recombinant protein-based vaccine proves highly effective, it encounters supply chain challenges due to a shortage of the necessary adjuvant. Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines can be rapidly produced on a large scale, but their effectiveness relies on efficient delivery and sequence design. Here, an mRNA-based VZV vaccine using a synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn-LNP) containing two different ionizable lipids is developed. Syn-LNP shows superior mRNA expression compared to LNPs formulated with either type of ionizable lipid and to a commercialized LNP. After encapsulating VZV glycoprotein E (gE)-encoding mRNA, mgE@Syn-LNP induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice. The magnitude of these responses is similar to that induced by adjuvanted recombinant gE proteins and significantly higher than that observed with live-attenuated VZV. mgE@Syn-LNP exhibits durable humoral responses for over 7 months without obvious adverse effects. In addition, mgE@Syn-LNP protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges. Preliminary studies on the mRNA antigen design reveal that the removal of glycosylation sites of gE greatly reduces its immune responses. Collectively, Syn-LNP encapsulating gE-encoded mRNA holds great promise as a shingles vaccine.",

        "title": "A study on the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and herpes zoster using Mendelian randomization",
        "abstract": "Introduction:The relationship between herpes zoster recurrence and the gut microbiome was not studied. We analyzed data on the gut microbiome and herpes zoster from the Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) database using bidirectional Mendelian randomization. For the first time, we identified a potentially bidirectional causal relationship between the gut microbiome and herpes zoster (HZ). These findings are groundbreaking and hold promise for new directions in the treatment of HZ, a global disease. Background and aims:HZ had a high global incidence, characterized by shingled blisters, blood blisters, and neuropathic pain, and could develop in various parts of the body, including the ear and throat. It was believed its onset was closely related to old age and infirmity. Some studies reported that the incidence of herpes zoster in patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) was higher than in the general population. Existing studies attributed this to the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) due to autoinflammatory attacks and immunosuppressive drugs. This provided a basis for exploring the new pathogenesis of HZ and investigating whether there was a relationship between intestinal auto-flora and the development of HZ. This study aimed to examine this potential relationship using bidirectional Mendelian analyses. Methods:GWAS data on HZ and gut microbiota were obtained from FinnGen, the Mibiogen consortium, and HZ meta-analysis data from the IEU Open GWAS Project. These data were subjected to two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine if there is a causal relationship between gut microbiota and HZ. Additionally, bidirectional Mendelian analyses were conducted to identify the direction of causality and to clarify any potential interactions. Results:In our Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis, we identified, for the first time, two gut microbes that might be associated with HZ reactivation. In the reverse MR analysis, four gut microbiota showed a potential association between the genetic susceptibility of gut microbiota and HZ reactivation. We found that genus Tyzzerella3 (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.17-1.72, FDR < 0.1) may be strongly correlated with an increased probability of HZ (ICD-10: B02.901) reactivation. Additionally, phylum Cyanobacteria was identified as a potential risk factor for the onset of HZ rekindling (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.09-1.87). Analyzing the results of the reverse MR, we also identified a potential inhibitory effect (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.99) of HZ onset on the genus Eubacteriumhallii group in the gut, suggesting that HZ might reduce its abundance. However, genus Escherichia/Shigella (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.22), genus Veillonella (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30), and phylum Proteobacteria (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18) appeared to act as potential protective factors, indicating that the relative abundance and viability of these three bacteria increased in the HZ state. Conclusion:We identified the influence of gut flora as a new causative factor for HZ reactivation. Additionally, we found that individuals suffering from HZ might potentially impact their gut flora. Specific bacterial taxa that could influence the onset and progression of HZ were identified, potentially providing new directions for HZ treatment.",

        "abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), known for causing chickenpox, establishes latent infections in neural tissues. Reactivation of VZV can lead to herpes zoster (HZ) and various neurological complications. In this report, we present four cases of VZV meningitis and myelitis following amenamevir treatment for HZ dermatitis with positive VZV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three of them were considered immunocompromised hosts given the fact that two of these patients were taking immunosuppressive drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, and one patient had a history of sigmoid colon cancer (four months after resection). After HZ onset, amenamevir, which has poor CSF transfer, was prescribed for all the patients, and all of them developed central nervous complications by VZV (meningitis in three cases and myelitis in one case) confirmed by PCR. All the patients were treated with acyclovir, which has a higher CSF transfer, and fully recovered. We speculate that amenamevir might have failed to prevent VZV infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and think that consideration should be given to administering acyclovir in preference to amenamevir for ΗΖ patients at high risk of CNS VZV infection, such as immunocompromised hosts.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims:According to the previous studies, herpes zoster (HZ) has been associated with cognitive function and dementia. There is a hypothesis claiming that dementia risk may be reduced by receiving the antiviral treatment for HZ. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to shed light on the association between dementia and HZ in individuals receiving and not receiving antiviral medications. Methods:Studies investigating the association between HZ and dementia were identified through a systematic search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases from January, 2000 to April, 2022. Data on the risk of dementia in HZ-infected patients under and not under antiviral treatment were extracted. The meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. The modified ROBIN-I tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias assessment. By utilizing the funnel plots, publication bias was investigated. Results:Six cohort studies on 538,531 patients were included. The overall risk of bias assessment was moderate. According to evidence-based cohort studies, there was a significant direct association between HZ and risk of dementia in patients with HZ, who did not receive antiviral treatments (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 1.28,p= 0.01). On the other hand, there was an inverse relationship between HZ and risk of dementia among patients with HZ, who received antiviral treatments (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.77,p< 0.001). Conclusions:This study demonstrated that antiviral therapies may significantly lower the risk of dementia in patients with HZ. This study also confirmed that patients with HZ, without receiving antiviral therapies, may have an increased risk of developing dementia. Further longitudinal research is warranted in this area.",

        "abstract": "The varicella-zoster virus reactivates to cause herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles. Shingles traditionally manifest as itchy vesicles in a dermatomal distribution, accompanied by related constitutional symptoms in immunocompetent patients. Usually, the rash resolves completely in seven to ten days. Herpetic neuralgia is the most typical herpes zoster consequence. Around 1% to 5% of individuals have motor impairments, with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome being the most prevalent ailment. Additional problems encompass abdominal pseudohernia, paralytic ileus/colonic pseudo-obstruction, hemidiaphragm paralysis, bladder dysfunction, localized paresis, constipation, and visceral neuropathy. Herpes zoster infection typically involves the posterior root ganglia, and most of the symptoms are sensory. Motor involvement can occur in the same distribution but is relatively uncommon. Segmental zoster paresis is a rare motor complication of herpes zoster, mimicking an abdominal hernia, which has an incidence of approximately 0.7%, but it needs no surgery different from the real abdominal wall hernia. In this case report, we describe a patient who, three weeks after developing a herpes zoster rash, acquired an abdominal protrusion, i.e., herpes-induced pseudohernia.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster (HZ) can cause substantial patient morbidity and lead to large healthcare costs. However, the disease burden of HZ in Southeast Asia may be underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the public health burden of HZ and the impact of vaccinating adults aged ≥ 50 years old in five Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam), with adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) compared with no vaccination. Methods:For each country, we adapted a static multicohort Markov model developed with a 1-year cycle length and lifetime horizon. Demographics were obtained from the World Health Organization, HZ incidence from a worldwide meta-regression reporting Asian-specific values, proportions of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and non-PHN complications from local/regional studies, and vaccine efficacy from a long-term follow-up trial. First-dose coverage and second-dose compliance were assumed to be 30% and 70%, respectively. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed to assess the robustness and uncertainty of inputs for each country. Results:Without RZV, it was estimated that there would be a total of approximately 10 million HZ cases, 2.1 million PHN cases, and 1.4 million non-PHN complications in individuals aged ≥ 50 years included in the model. Introducing RZV under 30% coverage could avoid approximately 2.2 million (22%) HZ cases, almost 500,000 (21%) PHN cases, and around 300,000 (22%) non-PHN complications. OWSA showed that first-dose coverage and initial HZ incidence had the largest impact on the estimated number of HZ cases avoided. The number needed to vaccinate ranged from 15 to 21 to prevent one case of HZ and from 68 to 104 to prevent one case of PHN across each country. Conclusions:This study demonstrated that there is substantial HZ disease burden in older adults for the five selected countries in Southeast Asia, negatively impacting national healthcare systems. Introducing RZV could potentially reduce this burden. A graphical abstract is available with this article.",

        "abstract": "Background:Currently, the recombinant subunit vaccine and live attenuated vaccine in the prevention of herpes zoster are approved for marketing in China. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the recombinant subunit vaccine and the live attenuated vaccine in the Chinese population. Methods:A decision tree-Markov analysis model was utilized to estimate expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), comparing the lifetime cost-effectiveness of vaccination with the recombinant subunit vaccine (London, United Kingdom, Shingrix, GSK) to that of the live attenuated vaccine (Changchun, China, Ganwei, Changchun Bcht) in the Chinese population, with the primary outcome measure being the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results:In the base-case analysis, the ICERs for the recombinant subunit vaccine ranged by age from USD 3428 to USD 5743 per QALY, while the ICERs for the live attenuated vaccine ranged from USD 4017 to USD 18,254 per QALY, compared with no vaccination. Among all age groups, the category of 60 to 69 years was the optimal age for vaccination. The results were most sensitive to changes in herpes zoster incidence, vaccine efficacy, and discount rate. Even with a two-dose compliance rate of 20% for the recombinant subunit vaccine, vaccination remained cost-effective. ZVL would need to reduce costs by at least 12.2% compared to RZV to have a cost-effectiveness advantage. Conclusions:The recombinant subunit vaccine and the live attenuated vaccine were both cost-effective in the Chinese population, but, relatively, the recombinant subunit vaccine had a greater advantage in disease prevention and cost-effectiveness in all age groups above 50 years.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the pain type (nociceptive or neuropathic) and neuropathic pain components in patients with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Methods:Patients with acute HZ referred to the outpatient Dermatology and Venereology clinic between January 2021 and January 2022 were retrospectively detected. The demographic data including gender and age, rash localization, pain severity, and neuropathic pain components were recorded. Pain severity and neuropathic pain components were evaluated using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4), respectively. Results:The study included a total of 58 patients, comprising 33 females and 25 males. Of these patients, 35 (60.3%) were found to have neuropathic pain. Itching, burning, pins and needles, and tingling were the most frequently reported neuropathic pain signs and symptoms. The proportion of female patients with neuropathic pain was found to be significantly higher than that of male patients (p=0.021). No significant differences were observed in the distribution of pain across different body sites or in the age of patients with neuropathic pain (p>0.05). Itching was significantly more common in younger patients (p=0.02). Conclusion:In conclusion, the study found that over half of the patients with acute HZ experienced neuropathic pain, and this was more frequently observed in female patients. Analysis of different components of neuropathic pain showed significant differences in age, gender, and site distribution. The findings of this study may have important implications for the manage-ment and treatment of acute HZ.",

Recent findings:SLE patients have unique infectious risks due to newer treatments and the nature of the disease itself. It is important to balance the benefit of additional protective immunity from updated vaccines against the possible risk of disease activity exacerbations. Summary:It is important to continuously evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of updated vaccines specifically for SLE patients. Additionally, the newly approved RSV vaccine should be considered for this population to reduce severe respiratory illness.",

        "abstract": "Background Herpes zoster (HZ) or shingles, arises from the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), mainly affecting older and immunocompromised individuals. Despite the efficacy of vaccines, vaccination rates in Saudi Arabia are low. Thus, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the Saudi Arabian population toward HZ and its vaccination. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate the public perception in Saudi Arabia toward HZ and its vaccination, during the period from January to March 2024. Participants were selected using a non-probability, convenience sampling method, with recruitment facilitated through WhatsApp, a messaging app. Data has been analyzed using the statistical software Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). A p-value of <0.05 has been used to report the statistical significance. Results The study's demographic profile included 1237 participants, predominantly younger than 30 years (65.5%), with a female majority (65.7%). Public knowledge about HZ was limited, only 29.6% of participants recognized the risk of HZ post-chickenpox. More than half of the participants were not aware that the vaccine is provided by the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) for certain groups. However, over 75% are willing to receive the HZ vaccine upon physician recommendation. Conclusion This study shows a general lack of awareness about HZ and its vaccination in Saudi Arabia, including misconceptions about vaccination availability, recommendations, and the disease's complications. Gender differences in attitude and interest highlight the potential for tailored educational campaigns. Addressing these issues is essential for improving vaccination rates and mitigating HZ's impact.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) results from the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The inflammation caused by VZV involves multiple tissues in the eyes. Our goal is to evaluate pattern electroretinogram (PERG) changes and their relationship with corneal sub-basal nerve changes in patients with HZO. Methods:Twenty-two patients with herpes zoster keratitis or conjunctivitis and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited for this cross-sectional study. A PERG test was performed on both eyes of HZO patients and one eye of the healthy controls. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was also performed on both eyes of the HZO patients to detect corneal nerve damage. Results:Our results showed changes in the PERG parameters in both eyes of HZO patients compared to the healthy controls. Affected eyes showed delayed N95 peak time and decreased P50 and N95 amplitude compared to the unaffected eyes (p < 0.05, respectively). Both affected and unaffected eyes in HZO patients showed delayed P50 peak time and decreased N95 amplitude (p < 0.05, respectively) compared to controls. In HZO patients, no significant differences in each PERG parameter were found between eyes with and without corneal lesions or between eyes with and without increased Langham's cells in the corneal epithelial sub-basal layer. The IVCM images showed decreased total nerve length and number at the sub-basal layer of the epithelial cornea in affected eyes compared to unaffected eyes (p < 0.05). No significant correlation was found between total nerve length and PERG changes. Conclusions:Our results showed that VZV-affected eyes without central cornea involvement displayed reduced N95 amplitude and prolonged P50 peak time in bilateral eyes compared to the healthy controls. Larger studies are needed to further explore the effect of HZO on the electrophysiological response of the eye and the posterior segment.",

        "abstract": "Objective:This paper presents a rare case of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) following a herpes zoster (HZ) episode, with no prior records found in the existing literature. Patient information:Specifically, we describe a case of a 76-year-old female whose diagnosis of SBE was hindered by the concurrent manifestation of HZ symptoms, which had emerged 3 weeks before the onset of SBE indicators. Follow-up and outcomes:This delay in diagnosis resulted in profound complications, including a cerebrovascular accident and significant mitral valve destruction. Discussion:HZ episodes have not conventionally been linked in the medical literature to the occurrence of SBE. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that HZ infections have been associated with the development of other consequential bacterial infections, such as pneumonia and necrotizing fasciitis.This case underscores the necessity for medical practitioners to recognize the possibility of HZ symptoms obscuring indications of critical underlying conditions and infections. The implications of this report highlight the significance of maintaining heightened vigilance for signs of other severe infections when managing patients presenting with HZ symptoms.",

It usually occurs in adults after remaining dormant in the dorsal root ganglia or ganglia of the cranial nerves for several years. It typically manifests as vesicle crops in a dermatomal or \"zosteriform\" pattern, which shows vesicle, ulcer, and scab distribution that is unilateral, clustered, and linear in a dermatome that is supplied by a single nerve. Patients usually experience prodromal symptoms of deep, severe aching or burning pain. Medicinal treatment frequently includes antiviral drugs to decrease the severity of the lesion and steroidal drugs to reduce symptoms of inflammation. It is also a known fact that steroid has several adverse effects on patients due to which therapeutic drugs with lesser side effects may be given to patients such as herbal medications. This case presentation reports a patient with HZ viral infection who was successfully treated with a meticulous combination of conventional allopathic drugs with ayurvedic medication with a significant positive response to the medication.",

This study aimed to explore the factors influencing sensory neuron involvement in HZ at different locations and its association with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). A total of 3143 cases were retrieved from an electronic medical record system, including 2676 cases of HZ and 467 cases of PHN. Gender, age, site of onset, past surgical history, and comorbidities were analyzed using a multifactorial logistic regression model. The results revealed correlations between age, gender, comorbidities (diabetes, coronary heart disease, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]), and sensory neuron involvement in HZ. Specifically, older age, female gender, and comorbid conditions such as diabetes/coronary heart disease were associated with sacral dorsal root ganglion (DRG) involvement, while PCI history was associated with lumbar DRG involvement. Additionally, sensory neuron involvement at different locations by HZ was linked to PHN. Furthermore, independent risk factors for PHN included thoracic DRG involvement, older age, and comorbidities (diabetes, surgical history, malignancy). It is crucial to prevent damage to the DRG, especially in individuals with comorbidities, through activities avoidance and active treatment, to minimize the occurrence of PHN.",

        "abstract": "The share of the elderly population is growing worldwide as life expectancy increases. Immunosenescence and comorbidities increase infectious diseases' morbidity and mortality in older adults. Here, we aimed to summarize the latest findings on vaccines for the elderly against herpes zoster, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), COVID-19, and pneumococcal disease and to examine vaccine recommendation differences for this age group in Europe and the United States. PubMed was searched using the keywords \"elders\" and \"vaccine\" alongside the disease/pathogen in question and paraphrased or synonymous terms. Vaccine recommendations were also sought in the European and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases. Improved vaccines, tailored for the elderly, mainly by using novel adjuvants or by increasing antigen concentration, are now available. Significant differences exist between immunization policies, especially between European countries, in terms of the recipient's age, number of doses, vaccination schedule, and implementation (mandatory or recommended). Understanding the factors that influence the immune response to vaccination in the elderly may help to design vaccines that offer long-term protection for this vulnerable age group. A consensus-based strategy in Europe could help to fill the gaps in immunization policy in the elderly, particularly regarding vaccination against RSV and pneumococcus.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) results from reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus. Recent observations have suggested that HZ is associated with vaccination against COVID-19. To investigate the association between the vaccine and HZ severity, a single-centre, cross-sectional study of all patients diagnosed with HZ and 2 control diagnoses (cellulitis and bone fractures), between 2017 and 2021, was performed. Hospital visits and hospitalization rates were compared. All medical records of patients diagnosed with HZ in the first year after the COVID-19 vaccination campaign began were reviewed, in order to generate a retrospective cohort comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with HZ. All participants had received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine. During the study period, 2,413 patients were diagnosed with HZ, and when normalized to control diagnoses the number of cases remained stable. The retrospective cohort included 365 patients. A multivariate analysis controlling for sex, age, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, and immunosuppressive therapy showed higher admission rates in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated individuals (odds ratio (OR) 2.75, 95% CI 1.27-5.96, p = 0.01). However, matching techniques and stratification by age, used to better control for confounders, invalidated these findings. No differences were observed in other variables indicative of disease severity (hospital stay length and complications). In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination was not found to be associated with an increased risk of HZ-related admission and complications.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To characterize the epidemiology of herpes zoster (HZ) and herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) in an urban hospital system and determine risk factors associated with developing ocular complications in HZO. To report the frequency of shingles vaccination and HZ reactivation following shingles vaccination in this population. Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients seen at the University of Illinois Hospital system from January 1, 2010 to December 1, 2021 with HZ and HZO identified by diagnosis code. Charts of HZO patients seen within 1 year of diagnosis were abstracted. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with the development of ocular complications in HZO. Results:During the study period, 3283 patients had HZ; mean age of onset was 52.3 years, 61.6% were female, and 37% were Black. HZO with ocular involvement was seen in 110 (3.4%) patients. Ocular complications developed in 40 (36.4%) patients; the most common complication was corneal scarring (70%). Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95%CI 1.0-1.1), female gender (OR 2.86, 95%CI 1.0-8.1), steroids at initial visit (4.46, 95%CI 1.4-14.6), and stromal keratitis (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.2, 9.8) were associated with developing ocular complications. Of eligible populations, 5333 (1.5%) received shingles vaccination; 43 patients developed reactivation of HZ following vaccination. Conclusions:In HZO, age, female gender, steroids at initial visit, and stromal keratitis are strongly associated with developing ocular complications. Shingles vaccination rates were low in this study population. Understanding potential for complications in HZ/HZO and vaccination uptake can help identify at risk populations to prevent disease.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Diseases associated with chronic pain are typically a major source of stress for patients; and have been linked to herpes zoster (HZ) development. Here, we investigated whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a potential stressor that increases the risk of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in affected individuals. Methods:The data used in this study were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database. The study cohort included patients aged between 20 and 100 years who had OSA during the period from 2000 to 2017 (with tracking completed until 2018). The case group and the control group were matched at a 1:1 ratio on the basis of age, sex, comorbidities, and index year, with patients who had outcomes before the index date being excluded. The outcomes considered in this study were HZ and PHN. The risk of HZ and PHN with and without OSA was calculated, and age, sex, comorbidities, and index year were adjusted for. Results:There were 25,211 patients in each group. Patients with OSA had a significantly higher risk of HZ (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.22) than those without did. The patients with OSA had also a significantly higher risk of PHN (aHR = 1.36) than those without did. In term of comorbidities, the patients with OSA without (aHR = 1.28) and with (aHR = 1.17) comorbidities had a significantly higher risk of HZ compared with those without OSA. In addition, the patients with OSA but no other comorbidities (aHR = 1.68) had a significantly higher risk of PHN than those without did. Conclusion:OSA increases the risk of not only HZ but also PHN. Therefore, patients with OSA should be aware of the potential effect of the disease on their stress levels, as well as the increased risk of developing HZ and PHN.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To describe the clinical and demographic profile of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) in patients presenting to a multitier ophthalmology hospital network in India. Methods:Cross-sectional hospital-based study included 3,004,470 new patients between August 2010 and October 2021. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of HZO in at least one eye were included. Data were collected using an electronic medical record system. Results:In total, 1,752 (0.058%) patients were diagnosed with HZO. Nearly two-thirds were male (63.76%) in the seventh decade of life (339;19.35% patients) with unilateral (98.34%) affliction. Higher prevalence was seen in patients from higher socioeconomic status (0.059%) and metropolitan geography (0.062%). Most common ocular signs included eyelid edema (44.19%), conjunctival congestion (65.69%), punctate keratopathy (23.36%), and anterior uveitis (21.22%). Of the 1,781 eyes, mild/no visual impairment was seen in 952 (53.45%) eyes, moderate in 258 (14.49%) eyes, and severe to blindness in 363 (20.39%) eyes. Oral antivirals were started within 72 h (Group A) in 361 (20.61%) patients and after 72 h in 1391 (79.39%) patients (Group B). Significantly lesser severity of ocular involvement was noted in Group A ( P < 0.00001). Surgical intervention was required in 211 (11.85%) eyes. Conclusion:HZO more commonly affects males in the seventh decade of life and is predominantly unilateral. It more commonly affects those from higher socioeconomic strata and metropolitan regions. Half of the eyes have mild or no visual impairment, while others have moderate to severe impairment. Institution of antivirals within 72 h is associated with less severe involvement. Surgical intervention is warranted in a tenth of the eyes.",

        "abstract": "This case report highlights a severe eczematous rash manifesting broadly across the scalp, face, and neck of a 54-year-old female following a resolved herpes zoster infection. Notably, such cutaneous reactions post-varicella zoster virus infection, which may present weeks to years after the acute phase, have been documented but remain poorly understood in their pathogenesis. This patient exhibited a blistering rash diagnosed as shingles with overlying cellulitis, initially treated with valacyclovir and cefalexin. Upon returning with a diffuse rash post-treatment, further examination and tests led to a differential diagnosis that most closely aligned with eczema exacerbation with superimposed bacterial infection, confirmed by the presence of methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus. Treatment encompassed intravenous vancomycin, ciprofloxacin eye drops, topical hydrocortisone, betamethasone lotion, and gabapentin, leading to substantial improvement. This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing cutaneous reactions post-varicella zoster virus infection and suggests a multimodal treatment approach may yield favorable outcomes.",

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) leads to euvolemic hyponatremia and hypoosmotic plasma due to inadequate diuresis. Hyponatremia in the current patient was caused by SIAD and associated with HZ of the trigeminal facial nerve (V1). The patient also had hypokalemia, with excessive urinary potassium excretion and elevated cortisol levels. Hypokalemia is caused by hypercortisolemia, which is stimulated by HZ pain. Adequate treatment for HZ and comprehensive pain control play pivotal roles in improving SIAD, cortisol hypersecretion, and the subsequent electrolyte abnormalities.",

        "abstract": "Amenamevir is an oral once-daily antiherpesvirus drug that can be administered without dose adjustment in patients with impaired renal function. There are currently no clinical data on immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster treated with amenamevir. Therefore, an exploratory study of the efficacy and safety of amenamevir against herpes zoster in patients with immunosuppression was conducted. Inclusion criteria included patients with acute herpes zoster receiving immunosuppressive drugs or those with malignant tumors or autoimmune diseases. Twenty-four patients were included and received amenamevir (400 mg once daily after meals) for up to 14 days. The primary end point of overall improvement in skin symptoms 7 days after treatment initiation (day 7) was 58.3% for \"markedly improved\" and 20.8% for \"improved.\" The combined improvement rate was 79.2% (95% confidence interval, 57.8-92.9), and 20.8% of patients experienced \"worsened\" symptoms. The secondary end points of overall improvement in skin symptoms on day 14 and day 28 were 95.7% and 100%, respectively. The skin symptoms progressed during treatment, peaking on day 7, and then began to heal. By Kaplan-Meier estimation, the median periods to complete crusting and healing were both day 14. There were five adverse events with a possible causal relationship to amenamevir (bacterial skin infection, anemia, hyponatremia, headache, and abnormal liver function) in one of the 24 patients. Although the bacterial skin infection was severe, all events in this patient were reported to be either recovered or recovering. These findings indicate that amenamevir can be effective and safe in immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster. However, as worsening can happen around day 7, it is necessary to carefully monitor such patients and switch to other therapies such as intravenous acyclovir if necessary.

        "abstract": "Background:Clinicians and healthcare policymakers have been drenched with a deluge of overlapping meta-analyses (MAs), and the necessity for comprehensive and clearly defined evidence of Janus kinase inhibitors (JKIs) in atopic dermatitis (AD) is urgent. Methods:Six databases were searched for MAs published until October 2023. Qualitative description of MAs was mainly used, and Investigator's Global Assessment response (IGA response), the 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (the EASI75), peak pruritus Numerical rating score (PP-NRS), and adverse effects were cited to describe the efficacy and safety of JKIs. The methodological quality of the included MAs was assessed by A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews II (AMSTAR II), and the quality of evidence was evaluated by the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE). Results:Sixteen MAs were pooled in this review, of which five studies appraised JKIs, five appraised systemic JKIs, five papers assessed abrocitinib only, and one assessed baricitinib. Two studies were of \"high\" methodological quality and 14 MAs were of \"moderate\" quality. Eleven MAs integrated the results of JKIs and reported that JKIs provide faster onset of IGA response (RR=2.83, 95% CI [2.25, 3.56], high-quality evidence). Similarly, 10 MAs showed that JAK inhibitors were more effective in improving the EASI75 (RR=2.84, 95% CI [2.2, 3.67], high-quality evidence). Results from 12 MAs showed JKIs were active in reducing the PP-NRS (SMD=-0.49, 95% CI [-0.67, -0.32]). All MAs affirmed JKIs added no adverse effects leading to discontinuation and serious adverse events (P<0.05). However, 200mg of abrocitinib had a higher risk of acne (RR=4.34, 95% CI [1.61, 11.71), herpes zoster (RR=1.64, 95% CI [0.42, 6.39]), headache (RR=1.76, 95% CI [1.03, 3]), and nausea (RR=7.81, 95% CI [3.84, 15.87]). Upadacitinib was known to increase acne (RR=6.23, 95% CI [4.08, 9.49]), nasopharyngitis (RR=1.36, 95% CI [1.03, 1.8]) and blood creatine phosphokinase (blood CPK) (RR=2.41, 95% CI [1.47, 3.95]). Baricitinib at 2mg was associated with increased blood CPK (RR=2.25, 95% CI [1.1, 2.97]). Conclusion:Compared to placebo or dupilumab, the administration of JKIs can ameliorate IGA response more effectively, improve the EASI75, and relieve pruritus without severe adverse effect, while accompanied by more acne, nasopharyngitis, headache, and digestive disturbances. The curative effect of 200 mg of abrocitinib is significant and more caution should be given in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction, herpes zoster, and those who are acne-prone. Baricitinib and upadacitinib should be avoided in populations at high risk for cardiovascular events.

        "abstract": "An 85-year-old woman with no history of herpes zoster (HZ) presented with a primary lesion of erythema and blistering on her left thigh and a secondary similar lesion on her right chest which had appeared at 4 and 3 days before presentation, respectively. Tzanck smears for both lesions were positive, revealing multinucleated giant cells. Immunochromatography to detect varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antigen (DermaQuick®VZV) showed positive on the left thigh at initial onset but negative on the right chest at subsequent onset. The latter repeatedly tested negative for VZV by DermaQuick®VZV. A skin biopsy of the subsequent onset area revealed giant cells, and inclusion bodies were observed in the epidermis. Immunohistochemical staining with anti-VZV antibody and polymerase chain reaction to detect VZV DNA were positive. The patient was diagnosed with HZ duplex bilateralis and treated with acyclovir. The right thoracic region of the posterior part of the lesion became negative for DermaQuick®VZV. It is thought that expression of viral antigens was suppressed in the right thoracic region, i.e., the late-onset area.",

        "abstract": "Rising number of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cases in developing countries necessitate clear guidance for clinicians for the appropriate use of advanced therapies. An expert consensus document was generated to guide the usage of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, in ulcerative colitis. Tofacitinib is a useful agent for the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. It can be used in the setting of biological failure or even steroid-dependent and thiopurine refractory disease. Typically, the induction dose is 10 mg BD orally. Usually, clinical response is evident within eight weeks of therapy. In those with clinical response, the dose can be reduced from 10 mg BD to 5 mg BD. Tofacitinib should be avoided or used cautiously in the elderly, patients with cardiovascular co-morbidity, uncontrolled cardiac risk factors, previous thrombotic episodes and those at high risk for venous thrombosis or previous malignancy. Baseline evaluation should include testing for and management of hepatitis B infection and latent tuberculosis. Where feasible, it is prudent to ensure complete adult vaccination, including Herpes zoster, before starting tofacitinib. The use of tofacitinib may be associated with an increased risk of infections such as herpes zoster and tuberculosis reactivation. Maternal exposure to tofacitinib should be avoided during pre-conception, pregnancy, and lactation. There is emerging evidence of tofacitinib in acute severe colitis, although the exact positioning (first-line with steroids or second-line) is uncertain.",

        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common, severe, and hard-to-treat chronic pain condition in clinics. Although PHN is developed from herpes zoster (HZ), the developing mechanism is unknown. A previous study investigated blood metabolomic and proteomic profiling in patients with PHN and HZ. The current study aims to explore the blood transcriptomic signature of PHN compared to HZ patients. Whole blood from eight PHN and 15 HZ patients was used for RNA-Seq analysis. There were 82 and 1,788 genes detected specifically in the PHN and HZ groups, respectively. PHN-specific genes are involved in viral infection, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and immune response. For genes coexpressed in PHN and HZ patients, there were 407 differential expression genes (DEGs), including 205 upregulated (UP DEGs) and 202 downregulated (DOWN DEGs) in PHN compared to HZ groups. DEGs are involved in viral infection, type I interferon (IFN), and hemoglobin and oxygen carrier activity. UP DEGs are associated with regulatory T cells (Tregs), activated NK cells, and neutrophils, while DOWN DEGs are associated with Tregs, resting NK cells, and monocytes. The results suggest that the metabolism of lipid, glycan, and nucleotides, type I IFN signaling, and altered neutrophil activation are associated with and might contribute to the development of PHN in HZ. It is also suggested that persistent or altered activation of nonspecific immunity may contribute to the development of PHN from HZ.",

We suspected vasculitis and performed skin biopsy. Histopathological examination showed multinucleated giant cells in the epidermis and fibrinoid degeneration of small vessels in the upper dermis. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction and we diagnosed the patient with atypical vasculitis-like herpes zoster. The patient was treated with oral valacyclovir, but the rash persisted and took 2 months to heal. Immunostaining using anti-VZV antibody was positive mainly in epidermal keratinocytes, but was also observed to be positive in cells in the dermis. We further performed RNA in situ hybridization using a VZV ORF9 mRNA probe and clearly showed that the distribution of VZV mRNA extended into the dermis, including the dermal vessel walls and the eccrine sweat glands as well as the epidermis. The internal administration of JAK inhibitors may induce regional widespread VZV infection including vessels and involved in the formation of prolonged vasculitis-like manifestation. RNA in situ hybridization can be a potent tool for detecting the spread of VZV infection in the skin.",

        "abstract": "Trained immunity may play a role in vaccine-induced protection against infections. We showed that the highly efficacious recombinant VZV-gE zoster vaccine (RZV) generated trained immunity in monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) and that the less efficacious live zoster vaccine did not. RZV stimulated ex vivo gE-specific monocyte, DC and NK cell responses that did not correlate with CD4 + T-cell responses. These responses were also elicited in purified monocyte and NK cell cocultures stimulated with VZV-gE and persisted above prevaccination levels for ≥ 4 years post-RZV administration. RZV administration also increased ex vivo heterologous monocyte and NK cell responses to herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus antigens. ATAC-seq analysis and ex vivo TGFβ1 supplementation and inhibition experiments demonstrated that decreasedtgfβ1transcription resulting from RZV-induced chromatin modifications may explain the development of monocyte trained immunity. The role of RZV-trained immunity in protection against herpes zoster and other infections should be further studied.",

        "abstract": "Background:The incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) is rapidly increasing, causing both clinical and economic burdens in China. Very little is known about Chinese residents' HZ vaccine preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for each vaccination attribute. Objective:This study aims to elicit the preferences of Chinese urban adults (aged 25 years or older) regarding HZ vaccination programs and to calculate WTP for each vaccination attribute. Methods:In this study, we interviewed 2864 residents in 9 cities in China. A discrete choice experiment was conducted to investigate the residents' preferences for HZ vaccination and to predict the uptake rate for different vaccine scenarios. A mixed logit model was used to estimate the preferences and WTP for each attribute. Seven attributes with different levels were included in the experiment, and we divided the coefficients of other attributes by the coefficient of price to measure WTP. Results:Vaccine effectiveness, protection duration, risk of side effects, place of origin, and cost were proven to influence Chinese adults' preferences for HZ vaccination. The effectiveness of the HZ vaccine was the attribute that had the most predominant impact on residents' preferences, followed by protection duration. The residents were willing to pay CN ¥974 (US $145) to increase the vaccine effectiveness from 45% to 90%, and they would barely pay to exchange the vaccination schedule from 2 doses to 1 dose. It is suggested that the expected uptake could be promoted the most (by 20.84%) with an increase in the protection rate from 45% to 90%. Conclusions:Chinese urban adults made trade-offs between vaccine effectiveness, protection duration, place of origin, side effects, and cost of HZ vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness was the most important characteristic. The residents have the highest WTP (CN ¥974; US $145) for enhancing the effectiveness of vaccines. To maximize HZ vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness.",

        "title": "Parabolic Changes in Pain Scores Among Partial Herpes Zoster Patients: A Retrospective Study",
        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) typically manifests in the acute phase with distinct blisters and severe neuropathic pain. Remarkably, a subset of patients initially presents with only a mild skin rash and moderate pain that gradually intensifies, following a parabolic pattern. Despite being frequently observed in clinical settings, the underlying causes of this trajectory and its potential connection with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) remain unclear. Methods:To investigate this phenomenon in-depth, we conducted a meticulous retrospective study involving 529 eligible HZ patients. All these patients sought medical care at the Third Central Hospital of Tianjin, China, between January 2020 and December 2023. Results:The research identified that 14.6% of the sample (77 patients) experienced pain scores aligning with a parabolic curve. This trend was significantly more prevalent in patients aged 60 and above, accounting for 90.9% of this group, and demonstrated a positive correlation with age. Moreover, 87.0% of these patients had pre-existing medical conditions, highlighting the potential role of comorbidities in influencing the pain trajectory. A concerning 45.5% of patients sought medical attention more than seven days after the onset of symptoms, a delay that could exacerbate neurological damage. Notably, among those following a parabolic pain pattern, 66.2% eventually developed PHN, a considerably higher rate compared to the broader patient population. Conclusion:We emphasize that healthcare practitioners meticulously assess patients who initially report lower pain scores for high-risk factors potentially leading to parabolic pain increases, including being over 60 years old, having comorbid conditions, and delaying medical consultation beyond seven days from symptom onset. Early implementation of supplementary pain management therapies may mitigate the risk of PHN development and enhance the quality of life for patients. This study furnishes clinicians with a deeper understanding of the variations in HZ-related pain trajectories, promising to improve treatment approaches and prognoses for HZ patients while paving the way for enriched clinical practice in the future.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Trochlear nerve palsy (TNP) is a common cause of vertical diplopia resulting from superior oblique muscle weakness. While herpes zoster is a well-documented cause of cranial neuropathies, reports of TNP associated with herpes zoster infection remain limited. Case presentation:We report a case of a 65-year-old patient with typical herpes zoster ophthalmicus on the left side of his face with subsequent corneal endotheliitis and isolated TNP. The MRI revealed a faint enhancement at the cavernous sinus on the same side as the TNP. Cerebrospinal fluid detected human herpesvirus 3, confirming the diagnosis. An intravenous antiviral was administered for 14 days with prolonged maintenance to prevent recurrence. Oral corticosteroids were also used as an adjuvant to reduce inflammation. After treatment, the uveitis subsided, and the vertical diplopia recovered partially. TNP from herpes zoster is a rare presentation. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms, including potential direct viral invasion, inflammatory responses, and possible vasculopathy affecting the trochlear nerve, are explored. Conclusion:TNP can be a rare neuro-ophthalmic complication of herpes zoster infection. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when assessing patients with cranial neuropathies in the context of herpes zoster. Prompt antiviral therapy and supportive measures can aid in the resolution of symptoms and alleviate potential long-term sequelae.",

Methods:A cost calculator was developed to assess the cost of illness of influenza, herpes zoster and pneumococcal disease in France. Direct medical costs related to diagnosis and treatment in the older adult population in both inpatient and outpatient settings were modelled over a 1-year time horizon. Scenario analyses were conducted to determine the impact of hospitalizations on the results by considering only influenza-attributed diagnoses. Results:In France, influenza has the highest incidence, followed by herpes zoster and pneumococcal disease. Similarly, influenza poses the greatest cost burden among all older adults, while pneumococcal disease poses the greatest cost burden among those aged 65-74 years. When considering only influenza-attributed diagnoses, the number of inpatient visits and associated costs was reduced by 63% in the overall older adult population. In the low-incidence season, the number of inpatient visits and associated costs were reduced by 69%, while in the high-incidence season, the number of inpatient visits and associated costs increased by 63%. Conclusion:Influenza remains a leading vaccine-preventable disease among older adults in France, resulting in a substantial economic burden that could be prevented by increasing vaccine uptake.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To study the incidence and risk factors of herpes zoster in patients with multiple myeloma and to evaluate the preventive effect of antiviral therapy. Methods:The clinical features of multiple myeloma patients with herpes zoster were retrospectively analyzed, the risk factors of herpes zoster and the effect of antiviral prophylaxis were analyzed. Results:Among 180 patients with multiple myeloma, 23 cases developed herpes zoster (12.8%). The incidence of herpes zoster was 19.1% in patients with renal dysfunction and 23.5% after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). The incidence of herpes zoster was higher in patients receiving bortezomib-containing regimens (21/137, 15.3%) than that in those without bortezomib (2/43, 4.7%), but there was no statistical difference (P=0.067). Antiviral prophylaxis was associated with fewer zoster infections, 8/111(7.2%) developed herpes zoster in patients who received antiviral prophylaxis, and 15/69 (21.7%) in those receiving no prophylaxis(P=0.005). 65.2% of patients with herpes zoster did not receive antiviral prophylaxis. Multivariate analysis showed that bortezomib treatment, AHSCT and renal dysfunction were independent risk factors for multiple myeloma with herpes zoster, while antiviral prophylaxis was independently associated with reducing the risk of herpes zoster. Herpes zoster had no effect on OS in patients with multiple myeloma. Conclusion:The risk of herpes zoster in multiple myeloma patients was increased. Antiviral prophylaxis can reduce the risk of herpes zoster in patients on bortezomib-based therapy. 题目:多发性骨髓瘤患者带状疱疹危险因素分析及预防性抗病毒治疗的作用. 目的:研究多发性骨髓瘤患者带状疱疹的发病情况及其危险因素，并评价预防性抗病毒治疗的效果。. 方法:回顾性分析合并带状疱疹的多发性骨髓瘤患者的临床特征，分析带状疱疹的危险因素以及抗病毒预防的作用。. 结果:180例多发性骨髓瘤患者中，23例发生带状疱疹(12.8%)，其中合并肾功能不全的患者的带状疱疹发生率为19.1%。自体造血干细胞移植(AHSCT)患者在术后带状疱疹的发生率为23.5%（4/17）。23例患者中21例接受含有硼替佐米的方案治疗，2例接受不含硼替佐米的方案治疗，接受含硼替佐米方案的患者带状疱疹发生率(21/137，15.3%)高于不含硼替佐米方案的患者的发生率（2/43，4.7%），但未显示统计学差异（P=0.067）。在未采取抗病毒预防的患者中，带状疱疹发生率为21.7%(15/69)，而在接受抗病毒预防的患者中，带状疱疹发生率为7.2%(8/111)，两者具有显著统计学差异（P=0.005）。65.2%的带状疱疹患者没有接受抗病毒预防。多因素分析结果显示，接受硼替佐米治疗、AHSCT、肾功能不全均为多发性骨髓患者带状疱疹发生的独立危险因素，而抗病毒预防与降低带状疱疹发生风险独立相关。带状疱疹对多发性骨髓瘤患者的OS无影响。. 结论:多发性骨髓瘤患者发生带状疱疹的风险增加，预防性使用抗病毒药物可降低基于硼替佐米治疗的多发性骨髓瘤患者带状疱疹的发生风险。.",

        "abstract": "Background:A higher incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) was found in people with decreased cell-mediated immunity. However, the relationship between cellular immunity and HZ infection in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRD) remains elusive. Objective:To investigate the role of CD4/CD8 ratio in patients with AIRD and HZ. Methods:This case-control study compared AIRD patients with and without HZ. We chose 70 AIRD patients with HZ as the experimental group and 140 AIRD patients without HZ as the control group. The clinical and laboratory findings were assessed in each trial participant. Results:The CD4/CD8 ratio (odds ratio [OR], 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.49) was independently associated with the occurrence of HZ after adjusting for various confounders. Nonlinear analysis has unveiled a more profound nonlinear relationship between the CD4/CD8 ratio and the occurrence of HZ in patients with AIRD. The OR of HZ increased with a decreasing CD4/CD8 ratio before the turning point of 2. The adjusted regression coefficient was 0.14 (95% CI, 0.05-0.37,p<0.0001) for CD4/CD8 ratio less than 2. Conclusion:The CD4/CD8 ratio was expected to be a very promising quantitative biomarker for predicting the risk of developing HZ in patients with AIRD.",

        "abstract": "Background:Previous observational studies have reported certain causal relationships between factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, physical activity, metabolic disorders, and the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ). However, there is controversy regarding the observed results across different studies. Our objective was to investigate the causal effects of these risk factors on the risk of herpes zoster through a Mendelian randomization analysis using two-sample bidirectional approaches. Methods:We conducted two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses to explore the causal relationships between different lifestyles, obesity assessment indices, metabolic indicators, and the risk of herpes zoster. All exposure and outcome data were sourced from publicly available data from genome-wide association studies. Results:In the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) analysis, body mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.160, 95% CI: 1.030-1.307,p= 0.014), Body fat percentage (BFP) (OR: 1.241, 95% CI: 1.050-1.467,p= 0.011), and whole body fat mass (WBFM) (OR: 1.199, 95% CI: 1.057-1.362,p= 0.005) exhibited positive associations with the risk of HZ. However, usual walking pace (UWP) (OR: 0.498, 95% CI: 0.254-0.976,p= 0.042) demonstrated a significant negative correlation with HZ risk. Other factors including alcohol intake frequency, smoking initiation, smoking status, insomnia, and sleep duration did not show significant causal relationships with HZ. Conclusion:Mendelian randomization studies revealed that BMI, BFP, and WBFM are risk factors for HZ. UWP showed a protective effect against HZ. These findings provide a straightforward method for evaluating future clinical practices aiming to develop personalized management strategies and assess high-risk populations for HZ.",

In this study, we investigated whether organic ED (OED) is associated with increased risks of herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Methods:A representative subset of Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database was employed for this study. Enrollees with OED from the years 2000 to 2018 were selected. To ensure comparability between the case and control groups, we implemented 1:1 propensity score matching based on age, index year, comorbidities, and medications. Results:The case group included 20,808 patients with OED, while the control group consisted of 20,808 individuals without OED. The OED group exhibited a significantly elevated risk of HZ (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.74) and PHN (aHR = 1.56) compared to the non-OED group. Conclusions:Men experiencing OED seem to face elevated risks of HZ and PHN compared to those without OED. ED may serve as a warning sign for individuals at HZ risk.",

We present a case report of a 61-year-old male with VZV vasculopathy who initially presented with herpes zoster ophthalmicus, subsequently complicated by meningoencephalitis and an acute infarct in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Imaging revealed acute and chronic infarcts in the capsuloganglionic regions, accompanied by thickening and enhancement of the left MCA wall. Treatment involved a 14-day course of intravenous acyclovir, supplemented with oral prednisolone, resulting in modest clinical improvement. VZV vasculopathy represents an infrequently acknowledged neurological syndrome, particularly prevalent among immunocompromised individuals. Early recognition and appropriate intervention offer promise in ameliorating outcomes for affected patients. This case emphasizes the importance of including VZV vasculopathy in the differential diagnosis of neurological deficits, especially within high-risk populations.",

        "title": "The public health impact of recombinant herpes zoster vaccination in adults over 50 years in Spain",
        "abstract": "The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is included in the Spanish National Immunisation Programme for adults 65 years of age (years), with a potential progressive catch-up program for adults 66-80 years, starting with 80 years. However, the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) increases significantly from 50 years. We estimated the public health impact (PHI) of vaccinating adults ≥50 years in Spain versus no vaccination, using a Markov model adapted to the Spanish setting. The model simulated a hypothetical ≥50 years cohort over a lifetime, with inputs from Spanish publications, databases, or publications from other countries where Spanish data were unavailable. Base case inputs included 67.7% RZV coverage and 61.1% second dose compliance. Outputs included clinical outcomes avoided, healthcare resource use avoided, and number-needed-to-vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one HZ case. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were also conducted. The model estimated that, compared with no vaccination, vaccinating adults ≥50 years in Spain (N= 19,850,213) with RZV could prevent 1,533,353 HZ cases, 261,610 postherpetic neuralgia episodes, 274,159 other complications, and 138 deaths through the cohorts' remaining lifetime, mostly in the 50-59 years cohort. Furthermore, 3,500,492 primary care visits and 71,156 hospitalizations could be avoided, with NNV = 9 to prevent one HZ case. DSA predicted NNV = 7 to prevent one HZ case when second dose compliance was increased to 100%. PSA demonstrated ≥200,000 and ≥1,400,000 cases could be prevented in 86.9% and 18.4% of simulations, respectively. Starting RZV from 50 years could therefore prevent a substantial number of HZ cases and complications. Increasing RZV coverage and second dose compliance could further alleviate PHI of HZ.",

A key strategy to mitigate infection-related complications has been immunization against common pathogens. However, the immunocompromised status of CLL patients poses challenges in eliciting an adequate humoral and cellular immune response to vaccination. Most CLL-directed therapy disproportionately impairs humoral immunity. Vaccine responsiveness also depends on the phase and type of immune response triggered by immunization. In this review, we discuss the immune dysfunction, vaccine responsiveness, and considerations for optimizing vaccine response in patients with CLL.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To observe the effect of ultrasound-guided platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection in the treatment of herpes zoster neuralgia (HZN). Methods:Eighty patients with HZN were randomly divided into observation group and control group, with 40 cases in each group. The observation group was treated with ultrasound-guided PRP injection of target nerves combined with drugs. The control group was treated with drugs alone. The pain scores of before treatment (T0), and 1 week (T1), 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T4) after treatment were recorded with Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The sleep quality of patients was assessed with the Athens Insomnia Scale, and the dosage used at each time point, skin lesions, adverse reactions, and the occurrence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) were recorded. Results:The NRS score of the two groups after treatment showed a downward trend. Compared with T0 at each time point, the difference was statistically significant (p< 0.05). And the NRS score of the observation group was lower than control group (p< 0.05). The sleep quality of the observation group was better. The dosage of the observation group was less, and the time of herpes dry-up, scab crusting and shedding in the observation group was significantly shorter (p< 0.05). The incidence of dizziness, lethargy, ataxia and PHN in the observation group was significantly reduced (p< 0.05). Conclusion:Compared with traditional drug treatment alone, the ultrasound-guided PRP injection has the advantages of better analgesia and fewer side effects, which provides a new idea for the treatment of HZN.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:We investigated the safety and efficacy of percutaneous facial nerve pulsed radiofrequency combined with drug injection for treatment of intractable facial paralysis of herpes zoster. The authors provide a detailed description of percutaneous facial nerve pulsed radiofrequency combined with steroid injection for treatment of intractable facial paralysis after herpes zoster, and they examine its clinical efficacy. This is the first time in the literature to our knowledge that this procedure has been applied in facial paralysis after herpes zoster. Methods:A total of 43 patients with a history of facial paralysis after herpes zoster for > 1 month were enrolled in this retrospective study. The patients were subjected to percutaneous stylomastoid foramen pulsed radiofrequency of the facial nerve under computed tomography (CT) guidance combined with drug injection. The House-Brackmann grades and NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) data collection were performed at different time points (preoperatively, 1 day post-procedure, and 2, 4, and 12 weeks postoperatively). The occurrence of complications was also assessed. Results:The 43 participants successfully completed the CT-guided percutaneous stylomastoid foramen pulsed radiofrequency of the facial nerve combined with drug injection. Both approaches [posterior approach of the ear (7 cases) and anterior approach of the ear (36 cases)] were efficacious and safe. The House-Brackmann grades (I, II, III, IV, V, VI) were 4 (3-4), 2 (2-3), 1 (1-2), and 1 (0-2) at different operation times (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4); patients felt significant recovery at T1 after operation and had gradually recovered at each time point but had no significant recovery after T3. The NRS scores at different operation times were 2.690 ± 2.213, 0.700 ± 0.939, 0.580 ± 1.006, 0.440 ± 0.908, and 0.260 ± 0.759, respectively. Differences in NRS scores between T0 and T1/2/3/4 were significant while differences between T1 and T2/3/4 were not significant. Six patients developed mild numbness, nine patients exhibited muscle tension, while one patient exhibited facial stiffness. During surgery, there was no intravascular injection of drugs, no nerve injury was reported, and there was no local anesthetic poisoning or spinal anesthesia. Conclusions:Percutaneous stylomastoid foramen pulsed radiofrequency combined with drug injection of the facial nerve for treatment of intractable facial paralysis after herpes zoster is a minimally invasive technique with high rates of success, safety, and effective outcomes. It is a potential therapeutic option for cases of facial paralysis of herpes zoster with a > 1 month history even for those with severe facial paralysis and whose treatment has failed after oral medication and physiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Trigeminal herpes zoster, which comprises 10% to 20% of cases of herpes zoster, often leads to severe pain in the ophthalmic branches. Current treatments, including drug therapy and minimally invasive interventions, have limitations; accordingly, there is a need to explore alternative approaches. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of computerized tomography (CT)-guided pulsed radiofrequency of the sphenopalatine ganglion in patients with intractable trigeminal herpetic pain. Patient concerns:Three patients with intractable trigeminal ophthalmic zoster neuralgia were studied. All patients complained of bursts of headache, which occurred at least 10 times a day, usually in the periorbital and frontal regions. Conventional treatments, including oral medications and radiofrequency therapy targeting the trigeminal-semilunar ganglion and supraorbital nerve, could not sufficiently provide relief. Diagnosis:Two patients were diagnosed with herpes zoster in the ocular branch of the trigeminal nerve with conjunctivitis, while one patient was diagnosed with postherpetic neuralgia in the ocular branch of the trigeminal nerve. Interventions:This study employed a novel approach that involved CT-guided radiofrequency regulation of the pterygopalatine fossa sphenopalatine ganglion. Outcomes:In all three patients, pain relief was achieved within 1 to 3 days after treatment. During the follow-up, one patient had pain recurrence; however, its severity was ≈ 40% lower than the pretreatment pain severity. The second patient had sustained and effective pain relief. However, the pain of the third patient worsened again after 2 months. The average follow-up duration was 3 months. None of the enrolled patients showed treatment-related adverse reactions or complications. Conclusion:Our findings indicated that CT-guided radiofrequency regulation of the pterygopalatine fossa sphenopalatine ganglion was a safe and effective intervention for pain in patients with trigeminal ophthalmic zoster neuralgia, suggesting that it may be a therapeutic option if other treatments fail.",

        "abstract": "Background:An increasing amount of evidence suggests that gastrointestinal diseases are risk factors for herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Among them, the gut microbiota may play a crucial role in this process. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential causal association between the gut microbiota and HZ and PHN. Methods:Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to detect the causal effect between HZ and PHN and the gut microbiota. Gut microbiota data were derived from the MiBioGen consortium, while HZ and PHN data were obtained from the FinnGen database. We selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables with a threshold ofp< 1 × 10⁻⁵ for the association with the gut microbiota in forward MR analysis andp< 5 × 10⁻8for the association with HZ or PHN in reverse MR analysis and then removed SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (r2< 0.001) within a distance of 10,000 kb for both the gut microbiota and HZ and PHN. These SNPs were utilized to assess the causal effect between exposures and outcomes using inverse-variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted mean, and weighted median tests. Results:The class Deltaproteobacteria, order Desulfovibrionales, family Desulfovibrionaceae, and genusCoprococcus 2were found to reduce the risk of HZ, while the phylum Cyanobacteria, genusEubacterium rectalegroup appeared to increase it. The class Coriobacteriia, order Coriobacteriales, family Coriobacteriaceae, genusLachnospiraceae NK4A136and genusRuminococcaceae UCG011were found to reduce the risk of PHN, while the genusCandidatus Soleaferrea, genusEubacterium rectalegroup, and genusMethanobrevibacterappeared to increase it. Moreover, the onset of HZ was found to increase the level of the genusEubacterium rectalegroup. These findings remained robust and unaffected by heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy among SNPs in both forward and reverse MR analysis. Conclusion:This MR study provided evidence supporting a potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota and HZ and PHN. Moreover, we found that the causal effect between the gut microbiota and HZ is bidirectional. Further studies are required to clarify the biological mechanisms linking the gut microbiota and these conditions.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients is significantly higher than that of the general public. Although routine antiviral prophylaxis is recommended, late-onset HZ has been highlighted, yet limited information is known about its clinical features and predictors. Here, we conducted a retrospective nested case-control study to identify patients with late-onset HZ, defined as a diagnosis of HZ after 1 year of transplantation, among allo-HSCT recipients between 2012 and 2017 at Peking University People's Hospital. Three controls were matched for each patient. A total of 201 patients developed late-onset HZ. Age over 20 years, absence of neutrophil engraftment by 14 days, mental disorders, immunosuppressant use at 1 year, and a peripheral CD4+/CD8+ ratio ≥0.5 at 1 year were independent risk factors, among which the CD4+/CD8+ ratio demonstrated good discriminative power for predicting late-onset HZ. For patients with a CD4+/CD8+ ratio <0.5, patient age, neutrophil engraftment time, mental disorders, and immunosuppressant use were potential risk factors. A stratification algorithm was accordingly established, classifying the transplant recipients into three risk groups. Whether the algorithm could facilitate the administration of posttransplant antiviral prophylaxis merits further validation.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:The relationship between varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection and the risk of dementia has not been previously studied specifically. Therefore, this study sought to determine the relationship between studying VZV infection and dementia occurring in the general population by conducting an extensive meta-analysis of published cases. Method:A systematic literature search was conducted in seven online databases by October 31, 2022. Heterogeneity was tested by the I2index. Pooled HR and 95% CI were used to estimate the effect of VZV infection on dementia. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias were also performed. Result:Nine studies involving 3,326,673 subjects were included. VZV infection was associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.21). The risk of dementia was reduced in those who received antiviral therapy compared to those who did not (HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99). In addition, VZV infection was found to be associated with an increased risk of developing dementia in the pooled results of the moderate quality study (HR = 1.81,95% CI: 1.27-2.59), and this association persisted when subgroup analyses were performed based on region (Asia: HR = 1.18,95% CI: 1.04-1.33). Conclusions:Our results suggest that VZV infection might increase the risk of developing dementia, but there is no clear mechanism about the true relationship, and since there is no effective treatment for dementia, and our results suggest that some populations can benefit from antiviral therapy, it is at least arguable that patients who develop VZV infection should be treated with appropriate antiviral medications.",

        "abstract": "Background:Shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, is usually diagnosed and managed in primary care. The lifetime risk of shingles in the general population is approximately 30%, and it can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. There has been little qualitative research about patient experience and understanding of shingles. Design and setting:Qualitative interviews with people recruited from primary care in England. Method:Qualitative semi-structured remote interviews were undertaken with 29 participants in a randomised controlled trial in primary care in England (ATHENA, ISRCTN14490832). Participants were aged >49 and were diagnosed within six days of shingles rash onset. Interviewees were sampled for diversity in terms of pain, intervention adherence, age, gender, and ethnicity. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Findings:Participants' understanding of shingles was limited, particularly pre-diagnosis. Television campaigns about the shingles vaccination programme helped some to recognise the rash. Shingles was understood as a disease with a variable prognosis, resulting in a sense of uncertainty about the significance when diagnosed. Participants reported a range of symptoms which impacted on everyday life. Some people thought their diagnosis was caused by poor mental health or challenging life circumstances, a perception sometimes reinforced by healthcare professionals. Many participants sought meaning in their diagnosis, reflecting upon, and sometimes changing, their life and circumstances. Conclusion:Primary care practitioners should be aware of the broad spectrum of patient knowledge, and the potential for better understanding to promote early attendance and treatment, to reduce the impact of shingles.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:This study evaluated the effectiveness, psychological effects, and sleep quality using intramuscular diazepam infusion compared with placebo in patients with herpes zoster (HZ)-related pain. Methods:The patients were randomized to either the diazepam or control group. The diazepam group received an intramuscular injection of diazepam for 3 consecutive days, while the control group received an intramuscular injection of 0.9% normal saline. The primary outcome was pain relief on posttreatment day 4, as measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Moreover, anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), respectively. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results:In total, 78 patients were enrolled in the trial. The mean differences in VAS scores between the two groups were 0.62 (P = 0.049) on posttreatment day 3 and 0.66 (P = 0.037) on posttreatment day 4. The effective rates of pain management in the diazepam group ranged from 10.26 to 66.67%, which were higher than those in the control group on posttreatment days 3 and 4 (P < 0.05). The mean difference in PSQI scores between the diazepam and control groups was 1.36 (P = 0.034) on posttreatment day 7. No differences were found in the incidence of analgesia-adverse 1reactions between the diazepam and placebo groups. Conclusions:The intramuscular injection of diazepam for 3 consecutive days provides effective pain management and improves the quality of life. Our study suggests that diazepam is more effective than the placebo in patients with HZ-related pain.

        "abstract": "This case report details a unique presentation of trigeminal herpes zoster with mucosal involvement in a 72-year-old female undergoing prophylactic valacyclovir treatment for suspected herpes labialis. The patient initially presented for a routine skin examination. Despite the absence of clinical evidence of herpes labialis, she was prescribed prophylactic valacyclovir. Three days later, the patient developed a unilateral rash, gingival darkening, and severe ipsilateral tooth pain. An examination revealed a crusted erythematous rash along the mandibular division of the left trigeminal nerve and a darkening of the gums. Diagnosed with trigeminal herpes zoster, she was treated with valacyclovir and a prednisone taper. A follow-up showed the resolution of the skin and gingival lesions, though herpetic neuralgia persisted. This case underscores the complexity and potential atypical presentations of herpes zoster, even under prophylactic antiviral therapy. It highlights the importance of considering herpes zoster in differential diagnoses, especially in patients presenting with unilateral dermatological and mucosal symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Human autoantibodies (auto-Abs) neutralizing type I IFNs were first discovered in a woman with disseminated shingles and were described by Ion Gresser from 1981 to 1984. They have since been found in patients with diverse conditions and are even used as a diagnostic criterion in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS-1). However, their apparent lack of association with viral diseases, including shingles, led to wide acceptance of the conclusion that they had no pathological consequences. This perception began to change in 2020, when they were found to underlie about 15% of cases of critical COVID-19 pneumonia. They have since been shown to underlie other severe viral diseases, including 5%, 20%, and 40% of cases of critical influenza pneumonia, critical MERS pneumonia, and West Nile virus encephalitis, respectively. They also seem to be associated with shingles in various settings. These auto-Abs are present in all age groups of the general population, but their frequency increases with age to reach at least 5% in the elderly. We estimate that at least 100 million people worldwide carry auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs. Here, we briefly review the history of the study of these auto-Abs, focusing particularly on their known causes and consequences.",

        "abstract": "Background:In South Korea, the National Immunization Program has included one-dose varicella vaccination for 1-year-olds since 2005. This study examines the potential impact of introducing a two-dose varicella vaccination for children, along with zoster vaccination for adults, using either the zoster vaccine live (ZVL) or recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV). Methods:The investigation considered four strategies in a base case scenario. The first involved introducing zoster vaccination for 60-year-olds, with a 60 % coverage. The second strategy combined zoster vaccination with a second-dose varicella vaccination for 4-year-olds, with a 90 % coverage. An age-structured model spanning 50 years was employed, assuming a zoster vaccine catch-up campaign over the initial 5 years. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted, assessing incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs), and net loss under different ages at zoster vaccination (50, 60, 65, and 70 years) and varying willingness-to-pay (WTP) levels from ₩40 million ($34,998) to ₩84 million ($74,000). Results:All strategies were cost-effective and significantly reduced herpes zoster (HZ) incidence, preventing approximately 3,077,000 to 7,609,000 cases, depending on the chosen strategy. The combined strategy prevented around 4,950,000 varicella and 653,000 HZ cases additionally. RZV outperformed ZVL by preventing twice as many HZ cases and offering greater QALY gains. However, ZVL was more cost-effective due to its lower cost. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that RZV became more cost-effective at higher WTP thresholds, exceeding ₩60.9 million ($53,193) in terms of ICER and ₩62.5 million ($54,591) for INMBs and net loss. The optimal age for zoster vaccination was 60 years concerning ICER but 50 years regarding INMB. Conclusions:Combining RZV with a two-dose varicella vaccination strategy reduced the disease burden and improved QALY more effectively, though ZVL remained more cost-effective at lower WTP levels. Decisions regarding vaccination policies should be balanced between the public health needs and WTP levels.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:The aims of this study were to examine the trends in the initial management of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) in the United States from 2010 to 2018 and compare them with the treatment preferences of corneal specialists. Methods:A retrospective, observational deidentified cohort study was conducted on individuals enrolled in the OptumLabs Data Warehouse who had a new diagnosis of HZO from 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2018. An online survey ascertaining HZO management perspectives was distributed to The Cornea Society listserv. The main outcome assessed was proportion of cases with systemic antiviral prescriptions, eye care provider involvement, and follow-up visits after the initial HZO diagnosis. Results:Approximately 50% of patients received systemic antivirals the day of initial HZO diagnosis or within 7 days (45.6% and 53.7%, respectively). Most initial diagnoses were made by ophthalmologists (45.0%), followed by optometrists (19.2%). Referral rate to ophthalmology within a year of initial diagnosis was 38.6%. 48.7% cases had at least 1 follow-up visit with any type of provider within 30 days. Our survey of corneal specialists found 97% would prescribe systemic antivirals to those with ocular involvement, but 66% would prescribe antivirals to those without ocular or eyelid involvement. Seventy percent supported all patients having follow-up with an eye care provider within a month. Conclusions:HZO antiviral therapies seem to be underprescribed in the United States, referral rates to ophthalmology are low, and follow-up is suboptimal, which are not aligned with recommendations from corneal specialists. More research is needed to establish standardized guidelines for treatment, referral, and follow-up with ophthalmology for HZO.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:To update the long-term safety profile of filgotinib, a Janus kinase-1 preferential inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Methods:Data from seven trials were integrated (NCT01888874,NCT01894516,NCT02889796,NCT02873936,NCT02886728,NCT02065700andNCT03025308). Patients received once-daily filgotinib 100 mg or 200 mg. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs)/100 patient-years of exposure (PYE) were calculated for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Post hoc analyses assessed patients aged <65 and ≥65 years. Results:Patients (N=3691) received filgotinib for a median (maximum) of 3.8 (8.3) years (12 541 PYE). Rates of TEAEs of interest: serious infections, malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and venous thromboembolism were stable over time and comparable between doses. In the overall population, numerically lower EAIR (95% CI)/100 PYE of herpes zoster was observed for filgotinib 100 mg versus 200 mg (1.1 (0.8 to 1.5) vs 1.5 (1.2 to 1.8)). Incidence of serious infections, herpes zoster, MACE, malignancies and all-cause mortality was higher in patients aged ≥65 versus <65 years. In patients aged ≥65 years, EAIRs (95% CI)/100 PYE for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (0.4 (0.1 to 1.1) vs 1.4 (0.8 to 2.2)), malignancies excluding NMSC (1.0 (0.5 to 1.9) vs 2.0 (1.3 to 2.9)) and all-cause mortality (1.3 (0.7 to 2.2) vs 1.6 (1.0 to 2.5)) were numerically lower for filgotinib 100 mg versus 200 mg. Conclusions:In the overall population, TEAEs of interest were stable over time and similar between filgotinib 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups, except for herpes zoster. A dose-dependent relationship between malignancies and all-cause mortality was suggested in patients ≥65 years old.",

        "abstract": "Anti-interferon (IFN)-γ autoantibodies are linked to varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. Given the elevated risks of herpes zoster (HZ) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis), we aimed to examine the relationship between anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies with HZ development in JAKi-treated patients. Serum titers of anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies, plasma levels of IFN-γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) were measured by ELISA. Among the 66 enrolled RA patients, 24 developed new-onset HZ. Significantly lower MCP-1 levels were observed in patients with HZ compared to those without (median, 98.21 pg/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 77.63-150.30 pg/mL versus 142.3 pg/mL, IQR 106.7-175.6 pg/mL,p< 0.05). There was no significant difference in anti-IFN-γ titers, IFN-γ levels, or IP-10 levels between patients with and without HZ. Three of 24 patients with HZ had severe HZ with multi-dermatomal involvement. Anti-IFN-γ titers were significantly higher in patients with severe HZ than in those with non-severe HZ (median 24.8 ng/mL, IQR 21.0-38.2 ng/mL versus 10.5 ng/mL, IQR 9.9-15.0 ng/mL,p< 0.005). Our results suggest an association between reduced MCP-1 levels and HZ development in JAKi-treated RA patients. High-titer anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies may be related to severe HZ in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Background:Vaccination is essential, especially in older adults whose immune system function declines with age. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdowns temporarily disrupted routine vaccination services. We aimed to assess vaccination coverage for Influenza, Pneumococcus, and Herpes zoster among older adults in Bavaria over time and investigate potential pandemic effects on these rates. Methods:Based on health claims data from the Bavarian Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KVB), we estimated the percentage of adults aged 60 years and older vaccinated following the German Standing Committee on Vaccinations (STIKO) recommendation for Influenza (2012-2021), Pneumococcus (2017-2021) and Herpes zoster (2019-2021), stratified by sex and 10-year age groups. Using time series regression analysis, we estimated the effect of the pandemic period (2020-2021) on quarterly Influenza and Pneumococcal vaccination rates. Results:In the first year of the pandemic (2020), Influenza, Pneumococcus and Herpes zoster coverage in both sexes increased by 9.9, 8.7, and 2.5 percentage points (pp), respectively. In 2021, Influenza coverage decreased by 4.7 pp., while Pneumococcus and Herpes zoster coverage increased by 2.7 and 3.8 pp., respectively. Influenza and Pneumococcal vaccinations showed a seasonal pattern, with vaccinations occurring mainly in the fourth quarter; this pattern was distorted for Pneumococcus during the pandemic. Per the time series regression analysis, Influenza vaccination rates in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2021 were 7.86 (95 %CI: 5.10-10.62) and 8.87 (95 %CI: 5.80-11.54) pp. higher for males and females, respectively, compared to that of the pre-pandemic period. During the pandemic, the quarterly Pneumococcal vaccination rates increased by 0.68 (95 %CI: 0.19-1.18) pp. in males and 0.80 (95 %CI: 0.30-1.30) pp. in females. Conclusion:The heightened increase in vaccination rates observed in 2020 may have resulted from increased vaccination awareness during the pandemic. As the pandemic effect wanes, more efforts are needed to sustain and increase these vaccination rates.",

        "abstract": "Background:This study aimed to compare the intercostal nerve block (ICNB) and thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) for acute herpes zoster-associated pain (ZAP) and possible prophylaxis for post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). Methods:This study enrolled 128 patients with ZAP. Their records were stratified into standard antiviral treatment (AVT) plus US-guided TPVB (the TPVB group), AVT plus US-guided ICNB (the ICNB group) or AVT alone (the control group). Herpes zoster (HZ)-related burden of illness (HZ-BOI) within the post-procedural 30 days was defined as the primary endpoint, determined by a composite of pain severity and follow-up duration. Procedure time, rescue analgesic requirement, PHN incidence, health-related quality of life and side effects were also recorded. Results:Significantly lower HZ-BOI-AUC30was reported in the TPVB and ICNB groups as compared to the control group, with a mean difference of 57.5 (P< 0.001) and 40.3 (P= 0.003), respectively. However, there was no difference between the TPVB and ICNB groups (P= 0.978). Both TPVB and ICNB reported significantly greater improvements in PHN incidence, EQ-5D-3L scores and rescue analgesic requirements during follow-up, as opposed to the control AVT. Shorter procedure time was observed in ICNB as compared to TPVB (16.47 ± 3.39 vs. 11.69 ± 2.58,P< 0.001). Conclusions:Both US-guided TPVBs and ICNBs were effective for ZAP, and accounted for possible prophylaxis for PHN, as compared to AVT alone. The ICNB approach could be recommended as an alternative to conventional TPVB with a better consumed procedure time and side effect profile.a.",

        "abstract": "Background:Reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in herpes zoster (HZ), which is a painful unilateral rash with a typical dermatomal distribution. HZ may be followed by postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), vasculopathy, myelopathy, retinal necrosis, and cerebellitis. Vasculopathy can cause ischemic stroke, aneurysms, arterial dissection, transient ischemic attack, and rarely, peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The possible mechanism is that the VZV travels to the arteries through the sensory ganglia, leading to inflammation and pathological vascular remodeling, which result in vasculopathy. Case description:Here, we describe a rare case of femoral artery occlusion induced vasculopathy 5 years after HZ. A 65-year-old woman visited our pain clinic with persistent pain following HZ that occurred 3 months earlier. She had several rash scars on the right thigh along with a continuous throbbing, shooting, and sharp pain. The patient was diagnosed with PHN and prescribed with medications that relieved the leg pain. The symptoms remained stationary for almost 5 years. She presented again with complaints of a paroxysmal tingling sensation in the right thigh and claudication due to increased pain, which had begun 6 months prior. She reported leg pain after walking for 10 minutes. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed foraminal stenosis at the level of right L2, with no abnormality below L2. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated for vascular diseases. Lower extremity ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed stenosis and thrombotic occlusions in the right superficial femoral and tibial arteries as well as the left middle femoral and tibial arteries. Surgical revascularization via percutaneous angioplasty was performed bilaterally. The leg pain was relieved after the procedure and the claudication improved. Conclusions:Peripheral artery occlusion is a rare phenomenon following HZ. In cases involving changes in HZ symptoms, further evaluation is required for potential vasculopathy.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:To conduct a meta-analysis of the association between postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), baseline characteristics of patients with herpes zoster (HZ), and early interventions. Methods:Literature searches were conducted in seven databases, in June 2021 and updated in June 2022. Two investigators independently conducted literature screening and data extraction, and the studies were evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results:A total of 53 cohort studies were included. The meta-analyses identified skin lesions, timing of initial treatment (≥3 days), and comorbidities as potential risk factors for PHN. In contrast, female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1.29), cervical herpes (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.21-2.99), lumbar herpes (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.61-2.74), and immunosuppressive therapy (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 0.22-17.12), were not significantly associated with PHN. In addition, glucocorticoid use (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.22-1.70) may be a protective factor for the development of PHN; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion:A series of baseline characteristics were identified among populations at high risk of developing PHN from HZ. Additionally, the timing of initial treatment is associated with PHN occurrence. The preventive effect of glucocorticoids warrants further validation.",

We identified 20 reports of which 15 met our case definition and causality criteria. All 15 patients (80% male, median age = 60 years) received isatuximab for a hematologic neoplasm; eight (53%) for previously untreated multiple myeloma. All cases described additional risk factors for VZV reactivation, including concomitant proteasome inhibitor and/or immunomodulatory drug (n= 10, 67%) use.

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the blog posts of HZ-related information on social media platforms to analyze the attitudes and behaviors of residents toward the dissemination of health information. This research used content analysis to focus on Weibo, a representative social media in China, to analyze the content of 1866 blog posts related to herpes zoster (HZ) and herpes zoster vaccine (HZV). According to the consistency test by Cohen's Kappa, four themes were identified: (a) sources, (b) tones, (c) epidemiological information, and (d) extended parallel process model elements. The findings showed that most information on Weibo came from non-professionals, with a neutral tone, and showed the invisible pain of HZ and the effectiveness of HZV through the two largest aspects of prevention and aged protection in epidemiological information. However, current blog posts treat the older adult as invisible individuals, failing to acknowledge them as recipients of the information. Additionally, the cost of the vaccine acts as an invisible economic barrier, contributing to the dissemination of incorrect information about folk remedies. This impacts the older adult's acceptance of health information related to HZV. Thus, the way to share health information with the older adult needs to be improved in the future, and attention should be paid to the transmission of incorrect information to improve their vaccination rates and awareness of health management.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds great potential in promoting healing and relieving pain for herpes zoster (HZ) treatments. Evidence showed that both healthcare professionals' (HCPs) belief and knowledge influence their attitudes, which result in their expression and direct behavior. However, little is known in this area regarding TCM treatments for HZ. This study aimed to understand the HCPs' perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and practices toward TCM and its services for HZ. Methods:During July 2021 and October 2022, a cross-sectional study of HCPs querying demographics, perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and practices toward TCM and TCM services for HZ was conducted. The frequency and percentage or mean and standard deviation were used to present categorical data and continuous data, respectively. A Chi-square analysis compared nurses' and doctors' views on TCM treatments for HZ. Results:Out of 306 eligible respondents, 66.0% used TCM content in clinical practice less than 40% of the time. Respondents reported that there were three main advantages of TCM for HZ, including better crusting and healing, fewer side effects, and mitigating complications. A total of 41.3% (81/196) of the respondents who had cared for/treated HZ patients applied TCM treatments. The three factors most associated with referrals/providing TCM to patients were postherpetic neuralgia, early erythema or papules, and acute pain. Compared to nurses, doctors showed more endorsement of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of TCM treatments for HZ patients. Conclusion:The study found that most healthcare professionals in HZ had a favorable view of TCM, but lacked practical experience administering it to patients. Programs should be developed to provide evidence-based TCM treatments and encourage combining TCM with Western medicine for better patient care.",

        "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The psoas: lumbar vertebral index (PLVI) is a simple and convenient measure to assess central sarcopenia. Recent studies have utilized the psoas area to indirectly assess sarcopenia and frailty, exploring their associations with various health outcomes. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the PLVI and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in patients aged 60 years and above following a herpes zoster (HZ) infection.Methods:We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 351 patients (≥60 years) who developed HZ between January 2019 and December 2023; the patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of PHN after HZ onset.Results:The analyses using receiver operating characteristic curves revealed a value for the area under the curve of 0.813 for PLVI and 0.769 for the modified frailty index (mFI). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, numerical rating scale scoring, a low PLVI, and a greater number of categorical mFI variables (adjusted odds ratio: 1.30, 3.27, and 2.46, respectively) were found to be significant independent predictors of PHN.Conclusions:Our findings highlight the association between a low PLVI and PHN in an older population. The PLVI may have potential as a predictive tool for PHN in older patients with HZ, but further research is needed to confirm these results.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes Zoster Neuralgia (HZN) and Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) are neuropathic pain conditions following Varicella Zoster Virus infection. PHN primarily affects individuals aged 60 and above and the pervasive and severe neuropathic pain in PHN leads to significant emotional and psychological distress in approximately 80%-90% of patients, precipitating a decline in their overall quality of life and that of their families. Galectin-3, a pro-inflammatory factor, is implicated in inflammatory responses, potentially influencing neuronal damage and pain signal transmission. Objective:This study aims to evaluate the clinical relevance of serum Galectin-3 in HZN and PHN patients, alongside other contributing factors. Methods:We retrospectively analyzed data collected from 40 HZN patients, 40 non-HZN patients, and 20 healthy controls in our hospital between 2015 and 2017. Variables included demographic data, clinical characteristics, and inflammatory markers. Statistical analyses comprised t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate Galectin-3's predictive value for PHN. Results:PHN patients showed significantly higher ages, NRS scores, and prevalence of shingles in the head and neck region compared to Non-PHN and Non-HZN groups (P < .05). Elevated levels of IL-6 (66.33±8.93 pg/mL) and Galectin-3 (2.44±0.29 ng/mL) were observed in HZN patients. Galectin-3 emerged as a significant risk factor for PHN development (P < .05), while other factors such as age, shingles location, IL-6, and T lymphocyte subsets did not show a significant impact. Conclusion:Galectin-3 may serve as a predictive biomarker for PHN development, offering insights into its pathophysiology and potential therapeutic targets. Patients with elevated Galectin-3 levels might benefit from specific targeted therapies or interventions aimed at reducing Galectin-3 levels and mitigating its effects.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:A single therapeutic approach is not always successful in the treatment of herpes zoster neuralgia, and the appropriate combination of different treatments deserves further exploration. In this study, we investigated the clinical efficacy of high-voltage long-duration pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) combined with stellate ganglion block (SGB) in the acute phase of thoracic and dorsal herpes zoster neuralgia under dual guidance of ultrasound and C-arm. Methods:79 cases of acute zoster neuralgia were grouped premised upon differing therapeutic approaches: standard voltage PRF (group S, the temperature, duration, pulse width, frequency and voltage were set to 42 °C, 300 s, 20 ms, 2 Hz, and 45 V), high-voltage long-duration PRF (group H, parameters of PRF were set to 42 °C, 900 s, 20 ms, 2 Hz, and 90 V, respectively), and high-voltage long-duration PRF combined with SGB (group C, parameter settings for PRF are the same as those for group H). The therapeutic outcomes were assessed utilizing the numeric rating scale (NRS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA). The incidence of clinically significant postherpetic neuralgia post-treatment had been documented. Results:Compared to baseline, scores of NRS, PSQI, and HAMA at each time point post-treatment decreased across all groups, and the decrease was more significant in the C group than in the S group. At the later stage of treatment, the consumption of pregabalin and tramadol and the plasma levels of interleukin-6 and galectin-3 in the C group were significantly lower than those in the S group. The incidence of PHN in the C group was significantly lower than in the S group. Conclusions:The combination of high-voltage long-duration PRF combined with SGB under dual guidance of ultrasound and C-arm represents a safe, effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-efficient method for treating AZN, significantly improving sleep quality, alleviating anxiety, and reducing the risk of PHN occurrence.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Ultrasound (US)-guided intercostal nerve block (ICNB) is an easier approach with a very low incidence of complications for different surgeries; nevertheless, only a few studies estimate the effect of ICNB for acute HZ. To explore the US-guided ICNB for management of herpes zoster (HZ)-related acute pain and possible prophylaxis for post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) taking the conventional thoracic paraverteral block (TPVB) as control. Methods:A total of 128 patients with HZ were retrospectively stratified into antiviral treatment (AVT) plus US-guided TPVB (TPVB group), AVT plus US-guided ICNB (ICNB group) or AVT alone (control group) based on the treatment they received. HZ-related illness burden (HZ-BOI) over 30 days after inclusion as the primary endpoint was determined by a severity-by-duration composite pain assessment. Rescue analgesic requirement, health-related quality of life, PHN incidence, and adverse events were also recorded. Results:Significantly lower HZ-BOI scores within post-procedural 30 days using the area under the curve were reported with TPVB and ICNB compared with the control group: mean difference of 57.5 (p< 0.001) and 40.3 (p= 0.003). No difference was reported between TPVB and ICNB (p= 1.01). Significant greater improvements in PHN incidence, EQ-5D-3L scores, and rescue analgesic requirements were observed during follow-up favoring two trial groups, while comparable between two trial groups. No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions:US-guided ICNBs were as effective as TPVBs for acute HZ. The ICNB technique was an easier and time-efficient approach as opposed to conventional TPVB, which might be encouraged as a more accessible preemptive mean for preventing PHN.",

        "abstract": "Background:Shingles can cause long-term pain and negative emotions, along with changes in brain function. In this study, Granger Causality Analysis (GCA) was used to compare herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) differences in effective connections within the \"pain matrix\" between patients and healthy controls to further understand patterns of interaction between brain regions and explore the relationship between changes in effective connections and clinical features. Methods:Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were performed on 55 HZ; 55 PHN; and 50 age-, sex- matched healthy controls (HCs). The brain regions associated with the pain matrix are used as the seeds of effective connectivity. GCA was used to analyze effective connections in brain regions that differed significantly between groups. Then the correlation between GCA values and clinical indicators was studied. Results:Compared with HC, GCA values between the thalamus and the amygdala, between the thalamus and the precentral gyrus, from the thalamus to the postcentral gyrus, and from the parahippocampal gyrus to the amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus were significantly reduced in HZ patients. Compared with HC, GCA values between the insular and the postcentral gyrus, from the insular to the inferior parietal lobe, and from the postcentral gyrus to the amygdala were significantly reduced in PHN patients. Compared with HZ, GCA values between the inferior parietal lobe and the parahippocampal gyrus, between the inferior parietal lobe and the anterior cingulate gyrus, and from the anterior cingulate gyrus to the amygdala were significantly increased in PHN patients. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score of PHN patients was positively correlated with the GCA value from the central posterior lobe to the insula. Conclusions:PHN and HZ patients showed a broad reduction in effective connections, mainly reflected in abnormal pain pathway regulation, pain perception, negative emotion and memory production, providing new perspectives to understand the neuroimaging mechanisms of shingles.",

        "abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a common pathogen with humans as the sole host, causes primary infection and undergoes a latent period in sensory ganglia. The recurrence of VZV is often accompanied by severe neuralgia in skin tissue, which has a serious impact on the life of patients. During the acute infection of VZV, there are few related studies on the pathophysiological mechanism of skin tissue. In this study, transcriptome sequencing data from the acute response period within 2 days of VZV antigen stimulation of the skin were used to explore a model of the trajectory of skin tissue changes during VZV infection. It was found that early VZV antigen stimulation caused activation of mainly natural immune-related signaling pathways, while in the late phase activation of mainly active immune-related signaling pathways. JAK-STAT, NFκB, and TNFα signaling pathways are gradually activated with the progression of infection, while Hypoxia is progressively inhibited. In addition, we found that dendritic cell-mediated immune responses play a dominant role in the lesion damage caused by VZV antigen stimulation of the skin. This study provides a theoretical basis for the study of the molecular mechanisms of skin lesions during acute VZV infection.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is a condition resulting from the reactivation of dormant varicella zoster virus within the sensory nerve ganglion in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The tell-tale rash along one side of the nerve tract accompanied by pain, a burning sensation, and itching alerts health practitioners on the right path to diagnosis. Conversely, HZO can present with other rarer complications such as intraocular and extraocular manifestations. This case report deals with a seemingly healthy 45-year-old female who developed left abducens nerve palsy within one week of developing a vesicular rash on the same side. Curiously, those afflicted are usually of an advanced age or suffer from an immunocompromised state; this patient however suffered from no other comorbidities nor did she report having been in contact with anyone of a similar affliction. In this case, the classical treatment regime of antivirals and corticosteroids resulted in the complete resolution of the infection and the return of full ocular function. Being able to recognize and appreciate these typical and atypical signs and symptoms of HZO can aid in the further propagation of good outcomes and timely resolutions.",

        "abstract": "This qualitative, cross-sectional study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators related to the adherence and completion of the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) two-dose series in Canada, as perceived by healthcare providers (HCPs) and patients. Data collection occurred via 60-minute concept elicitation interviews with 12 HCPs (4 physicians, 2 nurse practitioners, 6 pharmacists) who had prescribed and/or administered RZV in Canada, and 21 patients aged ≥50 years who had received ≥1 dose of RZV. Patients were categorized as adherent (received both doses within the recommended 2-to-6-month timeframe;n= 11) or non-adherent (received only one dose or second dose outside the recommended timeframe;n= 10). Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using a two-part thematic analysis approach. HCP-identified barriers to RZV adherence included high out-of-pocket cost, inconsistent/lack of health plan coverage, inconvenient processes for accessing RZV, and patient forgetfulness. HCP-identified facilitators included desire for shingles protection, HCP encouragement, and reminders. Barriers to RZV adherence identified by patients included lack of HCP knowledge/experience with RZV, receiving unreliable/confusing information, having unpleasant/severe side effects following the first dose, high out-of-pocket cost, lack of insurance coverage, and forgetfulness. Patient-identified facilitators included self-motivation, financial support, convenient processes for obtaining RZV, and reminders. In conclusion, many factors can influence RZV series completion and adherence among adults in Canada, including cost, insurance coverage, HCP knowledge and encouragement, and reminders. Awareness of these factors may inform HCPs in helping patients overcome barriers and identify opportunities for future consideration, facilitating protection against herpes zoster.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To study potential corneal reinnervation and recovery of corneal sensation in patients with severe neurotrophic keratopathy (NK) secondary to herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) after treatment with topical autologous serum tears (AST). Method:Four cases of HZO with severe NK were followed clinically and by serial laserin vivoconfocal microscopy (IVCM, HRT3/RCM, Heidelberg Engineering) before and during treatment with 20% AST drops eight times a day. Two masked observers reviewed the IVCM images and assessed corneal nerve alterations. Results:At baseline, all patients had complete loss of corneal sensation. In addition, IVCM showed complete lack of the subbasal corneal nerve plexus in all patients. All four patients were refractory to conventional therapies and were treated with AST drops. All patients demonstrated significant nerve regeneration by IVCM within 3-7 months of treatment. The total nerve density increased to a mean ± SEM of 10,085.88±2,542.74 μm/mm2at the last follow up. Corneal sensation measured by Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry improved to a mean ± SEM of 3.50±1.30 cm. Interestingly, 3 of 4 patients developed stromal keratitis with ulceration within weeks of corneal reinnervation, which was reversed by adding topical steroids. Conclusion:Autologous serum tears are effective in restoring corneal subbasal nerves and sensation in patients with severe NK secondary to HZO. However, this group of patients may require concurrent topical immunomodulation and antiviral therapy while on AST to prevent stromal keratitis.",

        "abstract": "We aimed to document vaccination coverage for five vaccines, predictors of each vaccine's uptake and attitudes regarding adult vaccination. Adults visiting four pharmacies were randomly invited to participate during summer 2022. Among 395 participants (mean age 51.2 years, range 19-96), vaccination rates were 78.1% for influenza and 25.8% for herpes zoster (≥60 years old), 64.3% for pneumococcal disease (≥65 years old), 33.1% for tetanus, while 11.4% had received two and 74.8% ≥3 COVID-19 vaccine doses. Half of participants (50.1%) voiced some degree of hesitancy, and 1.3% were refusers. The strongest predictor of each vaccine's uptake was doctor's recommendation (OR range 11.33-37.66,p< 0.001) and pharmacist's recommendation (4.01-19.52,p< 0.05), except for the COVID-19 vaccine, where the Attitude Towards Adult VACcination (ATAVAC) value of adult vaccination subscale's score was the only predictor (OR: 5.75,p< 0.001). Regarding insufficient coverage, thematic content analysis revealed seven main themes. Insufficient knowledge, the absence of health professionals' recommendation, perception of low susceptibility to disease, negligence and dispute of vaccine effectiveness were universal themes, whereas safety concerns and distrust in authorities were reported solely for COVID-19 vaccination. Designing public interventions aiming to increase trust in adult vaccination is essential in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health professionals' role in recommending strongly adult vaccination is crucial.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) is rare in healthy children, but more prevalent in those with leukemia. Optimal timing of chemotherapy reinitiation after HZ treatment is challenging because chemotherapy suppresses immunity and increases risk of HZ relapse. We aimed to optimize the timing of chemotherapy reinitiation after HZ therapy in children with leukemia. The study included 31 children with acute leukemia and HZ infection. General information, clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, duration of HZ treatment, and prognosis were compared with those of children with leukemia alone. Correlation analysis was performed for 20 children who restarted chemotherapy after HZ treatment. Of 31 children with leukemia and HZ, 67.74% had lesions at multiple sites. The median time from chemotherapy initiation to HZ onset was 14.1 (1.5-29.5) months. Among 27 children included in the follow-up, there was one case of HZ relapse. After excluding children who did not continue chemotherapy after HZ treatment, the median interval between completion of HZ therapy and chemotherapy reinitiation in the remaining 20 children was 8.00 (- 3 to 27) days. Lymphocyte counts (LY#) on restarting chemotherapy correlated inversely with HZ lesion healing time (p < 0.05). LY# at the time of HZ onset were lower than those pre- and post-onset, and lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, children with leukemia have a good HZ prognosis, but an increased risk of HZ recurrence. LY# at the time of chemotherapy reinitiation may be a useful indicator for selecting the optimal interval between antiviral therapy completion and chemotherapy reinitiation.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces professorFU Wenbin's clinical experience in the treatment of laryngeal herpes zoster with vocal cord paralysis, using the holistic mode of treatment, in which, acupuncture, moxibustion and consolidation regimens are integrated. Regarding the core pathogenesis of the disease, the invaded exogenous toxic heat is transformed into fire that flows to the throat. Soothing liver and releasing heat is the general principle of treatment, guiding the entire process of treatment. For acupuncture regimen, the filiform needling is used and the acupoint prescription is composed of Baihui (GV 20), Yintang (GV 24+), Lianquan (CV 23), the four-gate points (bilateral Hegu [LI 4] and Taichong [LR 3]), the group points for conductingqiback to the primary (Zhongwan [CV 12], Xiawan [CV 10], Qihai [CV 6] and Guanyuan [CV 4]), as well as bilateral Fengchi (GB 20), Wangu (GB 12) and Yifeng (TE 17). Besides, the pricking technique is delivered to the posterior wall of the pharynx for soothing the liver, regulating the spirit, reducing the heat and benefiting the throat. For the moxibustion regimen, moxibustion is applied to Fengchi (GB 20), Feishu (BL 13), the four-flower points (bilateral Geshu [BL 17] and Danshu [BL 19]), Shenshu (BL 23) and Mingmen (GV 4), which nourishes the spleen and stomach and reduces the heat pathogen through the heating action of moxibustion specially. In the stage of consolidation, the bloodletting and cupping technique is used at Xinshu (BL 15), Ganshu (BL 18) and Jianjing (GB 21) to eliminate the liver stagnation and the intradermal needling is delivered to sustain the needling stimulation and consolidate the therapeutic effect. 介绍符文彬教授采用“一针二灸三巩固”的整合针灸模式治疗喉带状疱疹伴声带麻痹的临床经验。外感热毒化火并流窜喉部为本病核心病机，疏肝泄热为治则贯穿整个治疗过程。一针即毫针针刺，选取百会、印堂、廉泉、四关穴、“引气归元”组穴，双侧风池、完骨、翳风等，并点刺咽后壁以疏肝调神，泄热利咽；二灸即精灸疗法，选取风池、肺俞、四花穴、肾俞、命门等，可温养脾肾，以热引热；三巩固即选取心俞、肝俞、肩井运用刺络拔罐疏肝排淤，并通过皮内针埋针持续刺激巩固疗效。.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims:Older patients with ulcerative colitis treated with tofacitinib are at risk for major cardiovascular events, thromboembolism, herpes zoster, and malignancies and, accordingly, its use is limited by the regulatory authorities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of adverse events and potential preventive measures. Methods:We retrospectively evaluated patients treated with tofacitinib, divided into two groups according to comorbidities and age. Patient- and disease-related variables were recorded [primary non-response, loss of response, and persistence], together with deviations from the recommended induction regimen, ie, dose reduction, and concomitant treatments with anti-thrombotic therapy. Results:The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index of Group 1 [n = 30] was ≥2 and that of Group 2 [n = 37] was ≤ 1. No differences were observed for primary or secondary treatment failures. Both groups achieved comparable steroid-free remission rates at 12 months [53% and 46%, respectively]. Herpes zoster occurred in two patients per group, and no more cases occurred after strict recombinant zoster vaccination. No major cardiovascular event or thromboembolism was registered. Half of patients in Group 1 were treated with a reduced induction dose of 5 mg twice daily and 47% were on concomitant anti-thrombotic therapy. Malignancies were registered in two patients from Group 1 and one patient from Group 2. Conclusions:Modulation of induction dose and anti-thrombotic therapy may have contributed to prevent cardiological events and thromboembolism. The introduction of zoster vaccine virtually eliminated zoster risk after the first cases. Potential malignancies deserve a careful work-up of older patients before treatment start.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:This study aimed to explore the abnormal changes in short- and long-range functional connectivity density (FCD) in patients with herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Patients and methods:Twenty HZ patients, 22 PHN patients, and 19 well-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. We used FCD mapping, a data-driven graph theory method, to investigate local and global functional connectivity patterns. Both short- and long-range FCD were calculated and compared among the PHN, HZ, and HC groups. Then, the abnormal regions were used to calculate seed-based functional connectivity. Finally, correlation analyses were performed between the altered FCD values and clinical datas. Results:Compared with HCs, HZ patients showed significantly increased long-range FCD of the bilateral cerebellum, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and lingual gyrus. HZ patients also displayed significantly decreased short-range FCD of the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus, median cingulate/paracingulate gyri, and left precuneus. Compared with HCs, PHN patients displayed significantly decreased long-range FCD of the bilateral superior frontal gyrus and decreased short-range FCD in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus, median cingulate/paracingulate gyri, and precuneus. However, there was no significant difference in either long-range or short-range FCD between the PHN and HZ patients. Long-range FCD deficit areas and the right insula showed altered functional connectivity in PHN patients. Furthermore, pain duration in patients with PHN was correlated with abnormal long-range FCD. Conclusion:Herpes zoster pain widely affects intra- and inter-regional functional connectivity, leading to disrupted short-range FCD and increased long-range FCD during different stages of the disease. Long-term chronic pain in PHN patients may impair the pain emotion regulation pathway. These findings could improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of HZ and PHN and offer neuroimaging markers for HZ and PHN.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:People living with HIV (PLWHIV) are susceptible to opportunistic infections including herpes zoster (HZ) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) (Shingrix) is available in some countries. However, the cost-effectiveness for PLWHIV remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of RZV for PLWHIV ≥50 years old. Methods:A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of the 2-dose RZV immunization program with no RZV immunization for PLWHIV aged ≥50 years. We built the model with a yearly cycle over a 30-year period and 6 health conditions: HZ free, HZ, PHN, HZ/PHN recovery, HZ recurrence, and death. The parameters in the model were based on previous studies and a nationwide administrative claims database in Japan. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as Japanese yen (JPY) per the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), was estimated from a societal perspective. We conducted a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulations of 10 000 samples, and scenario analyses. Results:The ICER of the 2-dose RZV immunization program over no RZV immunization was 78 777 774 JPY (approximately 600 000 US dollars)/QALY. The one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that HZ-related utility was the most significant for ICER. All estimates in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were located above the willingness-to-pay threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY. Conclusions:Our study revealed that no RZV immunization was more cost-effective than the 2-dose RZV immunization program for PLWHIV aged ≥50 years. This may be useful in evidence-based policy making.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Necrotizing fasciitis is an aggressive type of skin and soft tissue infection that results in necrosis of subcutaneous tissues, including muscle and fascia. Mixed bacteria, including gas-forming organisms, are usually identified. This report describes a 55-year-old male diabetic patient with herpes zoster involving the thoracic dermatomes complicated by skin infection, necrotizing fasciitis, chest wall abscess, and sepsis. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old man with diabetes mellitus presented with thoracic herpes zoster, initially treated with acyclovir and topical agents. He developed swelling, pain, and fever over the left chest, which was unresponsive to topical treatment. Investigations revealed elevated white blood cells and gas on chest X-ray. Computed tomography confirmed a 13×6×11-cm abscess with gas between the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles, suggesting necrosis. He received intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and metronidazole and underwent urgent surgical drainage, yielding 200 mL of pus. Cultures identified antibiotic-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens. Histopathology confirmed necrotizing tissue with acute bacterial inflammation. He was treated postoperatively with dressings and vacuum-assisted closure, followed by sutures, and was discharged in good condition after 16 days. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the aggressive nature and potential complications of necrotizing soft tissue infections in patients with diabetes mellitus and herpes zoster. Prompt recognition, early intervention with appropriate antibiotics, and surgical drainage are crucial in managing such infections effectively. The successful use of vacuum-assisted closure therapy underscores its role in facilitating wound healing after debridement. Clinicians should maintain vigilance for necrotizing infections in similar high-risk patients to ensure early intervention and improve clinical outcomes.",

Methods:Nationwide population-based cohort study of all adults hospitalised for viral lumbosacral radiculitis at departments of infectious diseases in Denmark from 2015 to 2020. Results:Twenty-eight patients with viral lumbosacral radiculitis were included (mean annual incidence: 1.2/1,000,000 adults). The median age was 35 years (IQR 27-43), and 22/28 (79%) were female. All patients had urinary retention, with 17/28 (61%) needing a catheter. On admission, at least one sign or symptom of meningitis (headache, neck stiffness, photophobia/hyperacusis) was present in 18/22 (82%). Concurrent genital herpetic lesions were present in 11/24 (46%). The median cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count was 153 cells/µL (IQR 31-514). Magnetic resonance imaging showed radiculitis/myelitis in 5/19 (26%). The microbiological diagnosis was herpes simplex virus type 2 in 19/28 (68%), varicella-zoster virus in 2/28 (7%), and unidentified in 7/28 (25%). Aciclovir/valaciclovir was administered in 27/28 (96%). At 30 days after discharge, 3/27 (11%) had persistent urinary retention with need of catheter. At 180 days after discharge, moderate disabilities (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 4) were observed in 5/25 (20%). Conclusions:Urinary retention resolved within weeks in most patients with viral lumbosacral radiculitis, but moderate disabilities according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale were common at the end of follow-up.",

        "abstract": "There is growing awareness that infections may contribute to the development of senile dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that immunopotentiation is therefore a legitimate target in the management of diseases of the elderly including AD. In Part I of this work, we provided a historical and molecular background to how vaccines, adjuvants, and their component molecules can elicit broad-spectrum protective effects against diverse agents, culminating in the development of the tuberculosis vaccine strain Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) as a treatment for some types of cancer as well as a prophylactic against infections of the elderly such as pneumonia. In Part II, we critically review studies that BCG and other vaccines may offer a measure of protection against dementia development. Five studies to date have determined that intravesicular BCG administration, the standard of care for bladder cancer, is followed by a mean ∼45% reduction in subsequent AD development in these patients. Although this could potentially be ascribed to confounding factors, the finding that other routine vaccines such as against shingles (herpes zoster virus) and influenza (influenza A virus), among others, also offer a degree of protection against AD (mean 29% over multiple studies) underlines the plausibility that the protective effects are real. We highlight clinical trials that are planned or underway and discuss whether BCG could be replaced by key components of the mycobacterial cell wall such as muramyl dipeptide. We conclude that BCG and similar agents merit far wider consideration as prophylactic agents against dementia.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Acute shoulder pain is among the most common presenting complaints in the clinic. Clinicians may find it challenging with the myriad of potential etiologies to explain for the presenting complaint. We present a unique case, where a herpes zoster infection in the C6 dermatome mimicked the presentation of rotator cuff pathology and was admitted to the care of orthopedics. We have also included a detailed literature review on the topic in our study. Case report:The patient was a 38-year-old Chinese female who presented with acute atraumatic right-sided shoulder pain and weakness which was potentially confounded by an attempt of traditional Chinese medicine. Clinical examination revealed that the range of motion was globally reduced and painful in all directions with equivocal impingement testing. Examination of the skin revealed the presence of polymorphous eruption of erythematous papules and vesicles in the right shoulder and C6 region. In this paper, we discuss a possible algorithm to aid clinicians in an acute shoulder pain history with accompanying red flags to look out for. This is accompanied by a detailed literature review on the topic which demonstrates the rarity of this presentation which eventually confounded the initial management of the patient. Conclusion:A thorough history and physical examination must remain the cornerstone of a clinician's diagnostic algorithm. Zoster neuropathy at the level of the cervical spine is a rare entity. This case report also emphasizes the need for cognizance of local traditional remedies practiced and their interactions with clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

        "title": "[Neurosurgical treatment of postherpetic neuralgia]",
        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia is a chronic and debilitating condition that can occur following an episode of herpes zoster (shingles). It is characterized by severe, persistent pain in the area where the shingles rash occurred. While various treatment approaches exist, including medications and non-invasive therapies, some cases of postherpetic neuralgia may require neurosurgical intervention. Neurosurgical treatment options for postherpetic neuralgia aim to alleviate the pain by targeting the affected nerves or neural pathways. One common approach is spinal cord stimulation (SCS). In SCS, electrodes are implanted along the spinal cord, and electrical impulses are delivered to interfere with the transmission of pain signals. This technique can modulate pain perception and significantly reduce the intensity and frequency of postherpetic neuralgia symptoms. Neurosurgical treatment of postherpetic neuralgia is typically considered when conservative measures have failed to provide sufficient relief. However, it is crucial for patients to undergo a comprehensive evaluation and consultation with a neurosurgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment approach based on their specific condition and medical history. The risks, benefits, and potential outcomes of neurosurgical interventions should be carefully discussed between the patient and their healthcare provider to make an informed decision. Постгерпетическая невралгия (ПГН) — это тип хронического болевого синдрома, который может возникнуть после эпизода опоясывающего герпеса (опоясывающего лишая). Он характеризуется сильной постоянной болью в области возникновения острой сыпи. Хотя существуют различные подходы к лечению, включая медикаментозное и неинвазивное лечение, в некоторых случаях ПГН может потребоваться нейрохирургическое вмешательство. Варианты нейрохирургического лечения ПГН направлены на облегчение боли путем воздействия на пораженные нервы или нервные пути. Одним из распространенных подходов является стимуляция спинного мозга (SCS). При SCS электроды имплантируются вдоль спинного мозга, подаются электрические импульсы, препятствующие передаче болевых сигналов. Этот метод может модулировать восприятие боли и значительно снижать интенсивность и частоту приступов ПГН. Нейрохирургическое лечение ПГН обычно рассматривается, когда консервативные меры не принесли достаточного облегчения боли. Тем не менее для пациентов крайне важно пройти всестороннее обследование и консультацию нейрохирурга, чтобы определить наиболее подходящий подход к лечению, основанный на их конкретном состоянии и анамнезе заболевания. Риски, преимущества и потенциальные результаты нейрохирургических вмешательств должны быть тщательно обсуждены пациентом с лечащим врачом для принятия обоснованного решения.",

        "title": "Predictive Value of Blood Glucose Coefficient of Variation for Prognoses in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus-Associated Herpes Zoster",
        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are common diseases in middle-aged and older adults aged 50 years or more, and the prevalence of DM-associated HZ is gradually increasing. Several studies have confirmed that DM is a significant risk factor for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). However, few studies have investigated the correlation between blood glucose-related indices and prognoses in patients with DM-associated HZ. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of blood glucose-related indices on the prognoses of these patients. Objectives:The purpose of this study was to observe the potential value of blood glucose-related indices in predicting prognoses in patients with DM-associated HZ. Study design:A retrospective, observational study. Setting:The study was carried out in the Pain Department of the First Hospital Affiliated to Jiaxing College in Jiaxing, China. Methods:Patients with DM-associated HZ admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing between October 2019 and February 2022 were enrolled. The patients were divided into PHN and non-PHN groups. Demographic data, including gender, age, period of first clinical visit, site of involvement, history of DM, DM-related complications, comorbidities, and treatment were collected. Simultaneously, blood glucose-related data, including blood glucose level at admission (GLUadm), blood glucose level difference (GLUdif), and blood glucose coefficient of variation (GLUcv) were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze factors affecting prognosis. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to assess the value of GLUcv in predicting prognosis. Results:Overall, 136 patients were included. Among them, 65 and 71 were in the PHN and non-PHN groups, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that gender (x^2 = 2.023, P = 0.044), history of DM (x^2 = 3.850, P < 0.001), DM-related complications (x^2 = 3.238, P = 0.016), comorbidities (x^2 = 2.439, P = 0.019), and GLUcv (x^2 = 3.576, P < 0.001) were associated with PHN. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a history of DM >= 10 years (OR = 4.096, 95% CI: 1.759-10.082, P = 0.001), comorbidities (OR = 2.680, 95% CI: 1.143-6.567, P = 0.026), and GLUcv >= 30.56 (OR = 5.234, 95% CI: 2.325-12.603, P = 0.001) were independent factors. The ROC curve revealed that GLUcv had a high predictive value for PHN (AUC = 0.714, P < 0.001). Limitations:The nonrandomized, single-center, retrospective design and small sample size are major limitations of this study. Conclusions:GLUcv has a high predictive value for the prognoses of patients with DM-associated HZ. The higher the GLUcv value, the likelier the patient is to have a poor prognosis.",

        "title": "[Left mandibular osteonecrosis following herpes zoster of the third branch of left trigeminal nerve: A case report]",
        "abstract": "Herpes zoster of trigeminal nerve was a common skin disease caused by varicella-zoster virus infection. Simple involvement of the third branch of trigeminal nerve was rare, and so were oral complications such as pulpitis, periodontitis, spontaneous tooth loss, bone necrosis, etc. This article presented a case of herpes zoster on the third branch of the left trigeminal nerve complicated with left mandibular osteonecrosis. We reported the case of a 64-year-old man with sudden pain in the left half of the tongue 1 month ago, and then herpes on the left facial skin appeared following with acute pain.The local hospital diagnosed it as herpes zoster and treated it with external medication. A few days later, he developed gum pain in the left mandibular posterior tooth area. He was admitted to Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology one week ago with loose and dislodged left posterior tooth accompanied by left mandibular bone surface exposure. Clinical examination showed bilateral symmetry and no obvious restriction of mouth opening. Visible herpes zoster pigmentation and scarring on the left side of the face appeared. The left mandibular posterior tooth was missing, the exposed bone surface was about 1.5 cm×0.8 cm, and the surrounding gingiva was red and swollen, painful under pressure, with no discharge of pus. The remaining teeth in the mouth were all Ⅲ degree loosened. Imageological examination showed irregular low-density destruction of the left mandible bone, unclear boundary, and severe resorption of alveolar bone. The patient was diagnosed as left mandibular osteonecrosis. Under general anesthesia, left mandibular lesion exploration and curettage + left mandibular partial resection + adjacent flap transfer repair were performed. The patient was re-exmained 6 months after surgery, there was no redness, swelling or other abnormality in the gums and the herpes pigmentation on the left face was significantly reduced. Unfortunately, the patient had complications of postherpetic neuralgia. This case indicate that clinicians should improve their awareness of jaw necrosis, a serious oral complication of trigeminal zoster, and provide early treatment. After the inflammation was initially controlled, surgical treatment could be considered to remove the necrotic bone, curettage the inflammatory granulation tissue, and extraction of the focal teeth to avoid further deterioration of the disease.",

        "abstract": "Background:Nerve fibers related to pain and temperature sensation in the trigeminal nerve territory converge with the upper cervical spinal nerves from the level of the lower medulla oblongata to the upper cervical cord. This structure is called the trigemino-cervical complex and may cause referred pain in the territory of the trigeminal or upper cervical spinal nerves. Case series:Here, we report three cases of paroxysmal neuralgia in the occipital region with mild conjunctivitis or a few reddish spots in the ipsilateral trigeminal nerve territory. The patients exhibited gradual progression of these reddish spots evolving into vesicles over the course of several days, despite the absence of a rash in the occipital region. The patients were diagnosed with trigeminal herpes zoster and subsequently received antiherpetic therapy. Remarkably, the neuralgia in the occipital region showed gradual amelioration or complete resolution before the treatment, with no sequelae reported in the occipital region. Discussion:The trigemino-cervical complex has the potential to cause neuralgia in the occipital region, as referred pain, caused by trigeminal herpes zoster. These cases suggest that, even if conjunctivitis or reddish spots appear to be trivial in the trigeminal nerve territory, trigeminal herpes zoster should be considered when neuralgia occurs in the ipsilateral occipital region.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:This study aimed to determine the immunogenicity and the influence on disease activity of an adjuvanted recombinant varicella-zoster virus (VZV) subunit vaccine (RZV) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Methods:This prospective longitudinal study enrolled 53 patients with RA (aged ≥50 years) treated with DMARDs (conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs 20, biological (b)DMARDs 23 and targeted synthetic (ts)DMARDs 10) and 10 control individuals. The participants received two intramuscular RZV 2 months apart. VZV-specific CD4+T cell responses (cell-mediated immunity; CMI) and IgG antibody responses (humoral immunity; HI) were assessed at 0 and 3 months after the first RZV administration using flow cytometry and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Disease activity (Disease Activity Score 28-C reactive protein and Clinical Disease Activity Index), flares and adverse events were monitored for 6 months after the first vaccination. Results:VZV-specific CMI and HI significantly increased in the three DMARDs-treated patients with RA after RZV administration compared with the corresponding prevaccination values (p<0.001-0.014), and the magnitudes and fold-increases of those responses were not significantly different among the three DMARDs-treated patients with RA. Furthermore, the vaccine response rates of CMI and HI were not significantly different between csDMARDs-treated patients and b-DMARDs or ts-DMARDs-treated patients. Meanwhile, no significant increases in disease activity indices or adverse events were observed in these patients during the 6-month follow-up period after the first vaccination. RZV-induced RA flares occurred in two patients (3.8%) but were mild and controllable. Conclusion:RZV is robustly immunogenic and has a clinically acceptable safety profile in elderly patients with RA receiving DMARDs.",

        "abstract": "Serious adverse events following vaccination include medical complications that require hospitalisation. The live varicella vaccine that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States in 1995 has an excellent safety record. Since the vaccine is a live virus, adverse events are more common in immunocompromised children who are vaccinated inadvertently. This review includes only serious adverse events in children considered to be immunocompetent. The serious adverse event called varicella vaccine meningitis was first reported in a hospitalised immunocompetent child in 2008. When we carried out a literature search, we found 15 cases of immunocompetent children and adolescents with varicella vaccine meningitis; the median age was 11 years. Eight of the children had received two varicella vaccinations. Most of the children also had a concomitant herpes zoster rash, although three did not. The children lived in the United States, Greece, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan. During our literature search, we found five additional cases of serious neurological events in immunocompetent children; these included 4 cases of progressive herpes zoster and one case of acute retinitis. Pulses of enteral corticosteroids as well as a lack of herpes simplex virus antibody may be risk factors for reactivation in immunocompetent children. All 20 children with adverse events were treated with acyclovir and recovered; 19 were hospitalised and one child was managed as an outpatient. Even though the number of neurological adverse events remains exceedingly low following varicella vaccination, we recommend documentation of those caused by the vaccine virus.",

        "abstract": "Skin disorders among individuals receiving palliative care may be associated with the primary condition or underlying comorbidities and patients may experience pruritus, discomfort or pain. Common conditions include xerosis, pressure ulcers, intertrigo, superficial fungal infections, telogen effluvium, pruritus, herpes zoster, eczematous disorders and edema. During end-of-life care, there is reduced skin perfusion and metabolism hence leading to susceptibility to infection, pressure and injury. Other factors affecting the skin include limited mobility, nutritional deficits and immunosuppression. Although treatment strategies for each skin condition are usually aligned with standard protocols, considerations among these patients include limited life-expectancies, potential treatment burden, drug-drug interactions as well as comfort-directed rather than cure-directed therapy. For patients with xerosis cutis, the regular use of moisturisers is recommended. The management and prevention of pressure ulcers include the strategies of skin assessment and care, pressure redistribution, nutrition and hydration and ulcer care. Superficial fungal infections require treatment with appropriate topical and/or systemic antifungals while antivirals and adjunctive treatment can be prescribed for herpes zoster. Treatment and symptom control of skin disorders in this population can improve quality of life and patients' comfort level.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To determine the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in patients with acute herpes zoster (HZ), this study developed and validated a novel clinical prediction model by incorporating a relevant peripheral blood inflammation indicator. Methods:Between January 2019 and June 2023, 209 patients with acute HZ were categorized into the PHN group (n = 62) and the non-PHN group (n = 147). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors serving as independent predictors of PHN development. Subsequently, a nomogram prediction model was established, and the discriminative ability and calibration were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The nomogram model was internally verified through the bootstrap test method. Results:According to univariate logistic regression analyses, five variables, namely age, hypertension, acute phase Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) score, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune inflammation index, were significantly associated with PHN development. Multifactorial analysis further unveiled that age (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.309 [1.163-4.660]), acute phase NRS-11 score (OR [95% CI]: 2.837 [1.294-6.275]), and PLR (OR [95% CI]: 1.015 [1.010-1.022]) were independent risk factors for PHN. These three predictors were integrated to establish the prediction model and construct the nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting the PHN risk was 0.787, and the AUC of internal validation determined using the bootstrap method was 0.776. The DCA and calibration curve also indicated that the predictive performance of the nomogram model was commendable. Conclusion:In this study, a risk prediction model was developed and validated to accurately forecast the probability of PHN after HZ, thereby demonstrating favorable discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability.",

In contrast, we observed a new facial symptom of herpes on the entire face without vesicles. Case summary:A 33-year-old woman with a history of varicella infection and shingles since an early age presented with sarcoidosis of the entire face and neuralgia without oral lesions. The patient was prescribed antiviral treatment with valacyclovir and acyclovir cream. One day after drug administration, facial skin lesions and neurological pain improved. Herpes simplex without oral blisters can easily be misdiagnosed as pimples upon visual examination in an outpatient clinic. Conclusion:As acute herpes simplex is accompanied by neuralgia, prompt diagnosis and prescription are necessary, considering the pathological history and health conditions.",

        "abstract": "In 2013, shingles vaccination was introduced in Wales as a routine immunisation programme for older adults. Invitation for this vaccination has historically been recommended but not mandated by vaccination policy. We surveyed general practices to investigate if invitations and reminders are associated with higher uptake of shingles vaccine. Using data from general practices, we calculated practice-level shingles vaccine uptake between 01/07/2021 and 31/06/2022 for registered patients aged 70-84 years. We distributed an online survey via email to all general practices in Wales on their use of vaccination invitations and reminders, method of invitations, and characteristics of their vaccination delivery. We used linear regression to calculate coefficients and 95 %CI to measure associations between invitations and vaccine uptake, adjusting for key demographics, with a multi-level component to account for similarities between general practices within the same health board. Survey response rate was 37 % (143/384). Median vaccine uptake for responding general practices was 57 % (IQR 50-68 %) compared to 58 % (IQR 48-68 %) nationally. General practices inviting all eligible patients (n = 95) had a 9 % (95 %CI 6-13 %) higher vaccination uptake compared to those inviting none or some (n = 48, p < 0.001). Of practices sending invitations, those who reminded all patients (n = 42) had a 6 % (95 %CI 1-11 %, p = 0.02) higher uptake compared to those that reminded none (n = 30). Practice size was associated with higher uptake, with small practices (n = 11, p = 0.02) having coverage 9 % (95 %CI 2-16 %) higher compared to the reference population (medium-sized practices, n = 78). General practices inviting and reminding all eligible patients for shingles vaccination have a higher uptake compared to those inviting and reminding only some or none. From September 2023, shingles vaccination policy in Wales has been updated to explicitly mandate effective universal call and recall mechanisms in general practices.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:This meta-analysis aimed to ascertain whether small molecule drugs increase the risk of infection or malignancy in adult IBD patients. Methods:A comprehensive search of eight databases was conducted from their inception to November 2023. The risk of infections or malignancies in adult IBD patients treated with JAK inhibitors and S1P receptor modulators was compared. Fixed-effects or random-effects models were performed, and relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results:27 RCTs from 14 studies were included (n = 10,623). The evidence indicates that small molecule drugs increase the risk of any infections (RR: 1.23, 95 %CI: 1.05-1.44) and herpes zoster (RR: 2.23, 95 %CI: 1.39-3.57). Specifically, UC patients on Filgotinib and Tofacitinib, and CD patients on Upadacitinib, showed elevated risks of any infections (RR: 1.27, 95 % CI: 1.04-1.56; RR: 1.42, 95 % CI: 1.16-1.75; RR: 1.57, 95 % CI: 1.11-2.22). CD patients on Upadacitinib also had a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster (RR: 2.64, 95 %CI: 1.16-5.99). No infections were associated with S1P receptor modulators, and similarly, no malignancies were linked to small molecule drugs. Conclusions:JAK inhibitors increase the risk of any infections and herpes zoster Over a one-year follow-up period in IBD patients. Continuous monitoring of their long-term safety is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:To investigate the efficacy and safety of pulsed radiofrequency of the dorsal root ganglion combined with ozone injection for treating acute herpes zoster (HZ) neuralgia in middle-aged and elderly adults. Methods:A total of 164 middle-aged and elderly patients with acute HZ were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the pulsed radiofrequency combined with ozone injection group (group A) and the pulsed radiofrequency group (group B). The therapeutic effects were evaluated using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores and the average doses of gabapentin (mg/d) preoperatively and 1 day, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks postoperatively. The incidence of clinically significant postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and complications in the 2 groups were recorded. Results:The data showed that the NRS scores and the doses of gabapentin after treatment were significantly lower when compared with the baseline values in both groups. Compared with group B, the NRS scores and the doses of postoperative gabapentin were significantly lower in group A. The incidence of PHN was significantly lower at weeks 4, 12, and 24 in group A than in group B. No adverse reactions occurred in either of the 2 groups post-treatment. Conclusions:The results indicated that ozone injection in the dorsal root ganglion combined with pulsed radiofrequency therapy was more effective in treating acute HZ neuralgia in middle-aged and elderly adults. It provides patients with longer-lasting pain relief, decreased incidence of PHN and the doses of medication, and improved quality of life than with Pulsed Radiofrequency treatment.",

In this study, we present the case of a 71-year-old female patient with a previous diagnosis of variant HCL who experienced a severe herpes zoster infection leading to an extensive skin eruption. The patient's initial diagnosis of HCL occurred 7 years ago, and she underwent treatment with cladribine, interferon, COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone), benztropine tablets + clarithromycin dispersible, and ibrutinib. Immune disorders resulting from repeated prior chemotherapy and targeted therapy may potentially precipitate herpes zoster infection. Despite an initial two-week period of unresponsiveness to antivirals and nerve nutrition treatments, the introduction of topical Coptis liquid to the treatment regimen yielded significant efficacy. This case report underscores the potential of Chinese medicine as an adjunct to conventional antiviral therapy in the management of herpes zoster infection in immunocompromised patients. This treatment protocol has the potential to enhance efficacy, enhance quality of life, and serve as a more robust foundation for clinical diagnosis and improved treatments.",

MAIT cell activation plays an immunoprotective role against several pathogens, however the functional capacity of MAIT cells following direct infection or exposure to infectious agents remains poorly defined. We investigated the impact of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) on blood-derived MAIT cells and report virus-mediated impairment of activation, cytokine production, and altered transcription factor expression by VZV infected (antigen+) and VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells in response to TCR-dependent and -independent stimulation. Furthermore, we reveal that suppression of VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells is not mediated by a soluble factor from neighbouring VZV infected (antigen+) MAIT cells. Finally, we demonstrate that VZV impairs the cytolytic potential of MAIT cells in response to riboflavin synthesising bacteria. In summary, we report a virus-mediated immune-evasion strategy that disarms MAIT cell responses.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is usually treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) and more recently, Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi). Randomized trials suggest similar infection risks for JAKi and bDMARDs, but real-world data are scarce. Methods:From a nationally representative prescription database, adult RA patients starting a new JAKi or bDMARD between August 1st, 2018, and January 31st, 2021, were included. Prescriptions of antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal medication were used as proxy for infections. Infection incidence rates (IR) were compared between JAKi and bDMARDs and infection risks were estimated using multilevel Poisson regression adjusted for follow-up time and potential confounders and stratified for age < 65 and ≥ 65 years. Results:In 14,989 patients, we identified 20,050 treatment episodes with either JAKi or bDMARDs. The infection IR was significantly higher in JAKi (48/100 patient years) compared bDMARDs (35/100 patient years, adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.12-1.33). More herpes zoster infections were seen in JAKi compared to bDMARDs (adjusted IRR 2.65, 95% CI 1.94-3.60). No significant differences in infection IRs were found comparing JAKi baricitinib and tofacitinib. In older patients, infection IRs were higher, but IRRs were similar between age groups. Conclusion:In comparison to bDMARDs, JAKi are associated with a slightly higher infection risk and a higher risk of herpes zoster specifically. In older patients, infection IRs are higher but similar infection risks for JAKi and bDMARDs are observed. No differences in infection risk between tofacitinib and baricitinib were found. Key Points • Compared to bDMARDs, JAKi are associated with a slightly higher infection risk for all ages • An increased risk of herpes zoster in patients who use JAK inhibitors was confirmed • No significant differences in infection incidence were found between tofacitinib and baricitinib.",

It has been defined by a herpes zoster oticus, which can be associated with further cranial nerve lesions and acute peripheral facial nerve palsies. In this case, we present a 73-year-old female patient who presented to the outpatient department (OPD) with unbearable pain in the lower left cheek that she had been experiencing for the last four days. The reported pain was continuous and could be described as deep-aching and burning. Facial swelling was observed in relation to the lower lip, especially in the vermillion area; there was ulceration, paralysis seen on the left face, and swelling on the submandibular region. Intravenous corticosteroids and antiviral drugs were administered to her for seven days as an association therapy. In this report, the authors want to stress the necessity of using adequate clinical examination and early intervention in the case of the Ramsay Hunt syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and can lead to complications such as postherpetic neuralgia. Although vaccines are available to prevent HZ, the level of concern about HZ and its vaccines in our region remains unknown. This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding HZ and the HZ vaccines among adults aged ≥50 years in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire distributed to adults aged ≥50 years and data were collected on demographics, knowledge of HZ and its vaccines, attitudes, and practices. Multiple logistic regression examined factors associated with knowledge levels. Results Of 295 participants, 58% and 67.5% had low knowledge of HZ and its vaccines, respectively. Knowledge of HZ significantly differed by age, education, and occupation. Only 50% knew HZ affects nerves and skin and 28.8% knew HZ can be transmitted between individuals. Knowledge of the vaccine significantly differed by gender and information source. Conclusions This population has substantial knowledge gaps regarding HZ and vaccination. Targeted educational initiatives are needed to promote greater awareness of HZ immunization, especially for higher-risk groups like older adults and females.",

        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia results from varicella-zoster virus reactivation post-chickenpox infection, manifesting as persistent and severe pain lasting a minimum of 3-mo post-herpes zoster onset. Traditional postherpetic neuralgia management comprises antiviral, analgesic medications, corticosteroids, and various agents. Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks have recently emerged as a promising postherpetic neuralgia treatment. In a case involving a 58-year-old man with severe thoracic herpes zoster lesions, the serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block was employed under ultrasound guidance, significantly reducing pain scores and enhancing quality of recovery. This study underscores serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block's secure, effective role in managing thoracic herpes zoster, and mitigating postherpetic neuralgia risk. This case report represents the pioneering application of serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block for postherpetic neuralgia, offering a promising avenue for relieving patients suffering from this condition.",

Since their approval, several cutaneous reactions related to vaccination have been reported in the literature. Among these, viral reactivations are one of the most frequent. The aim of this article was to investigate the current literature regarding viral reactivations following COVID-19 vaccination, focusing attention on pityriasis rosea (PR), herpes zoster and herpes simplex. A comprehensive literature search using various databases was performed and we included metanalyses, reviews, letters to the editor, real-life studies, case series and reports. A total of 48 articles involving 2067 patients were selected. Of these, 32, 6 and 17 articles reported varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation (1758 patients), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (238 patients) onset and PR (71 patients), respectively (some articles discussed more than one of these three reactivations). Possible pathogenetic mechanisms underlying viral reactivation are still not understood. Also, the possible correlations between vaccination and viral reactivation should be clarified. Certainly, vaccination should not be discouraged.",

NTZ inhibits leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier, preventing autoreactive cells from inciting an inflammatory immune response. This immunosuppression is highly efficacious in attenuating the risk of relapse of disease, but has been associated with opportunistic central nervous system (CNS) infections, most notably progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Varicella-zoster and herpes simplex viruses have also been associated with NTZ, inciting a spectrum of disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, and acute retinal necrosis. While rare, these infections can result in devastating outcomes even when promptly identified and treated.

If true, then vaccines that have heterologous effects on immunity, extending beyond protection against the targeted disease, may hold a potential for AD prevention. Methods:We evaluated the associations of common adult infections (herpes simplex, zoster (shingles), pneumonia, and recurrent mycoses), and vaccinations against shingles and pneumonia, with the risks of AD and other dementias in a pseudorandomized sample of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Results:Shingles, pneumonia and mycoses, diagnosed between ages 65 and 75, were all associated with significantly increased risk of AD later in life, by 16 %-42 %. Pneumococcal and shingles vaccines administered between ages 65-75 were both associated with a significantly lower risk of AD, by 15 %-21 %. These effects became less pronounced when AD was combined with other dementias. Discussion:Our findings suggest that both the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and the live attenuated zoster vaccine can offer significant protection against AD. It remains to be determined if non-live shingles vaccine has a similar beneficial effect on AD. This study also found significant associations of various infections with the risk of AD, but not with the risks of other dementias. This indicates that vulnerability to infections may play a more significant role in AD than in other types of dementia, which warrants further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster is an infectious skin disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which has been latent in the posterior root ganglia of the spinal cord or cranial ganglia for an extended period. Neurological complications caused by herpes zoster include aseptic meningitis, white matter disease, peripheral motor neuropathy, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, reduced unilateral sweating caused by the VZV is very rare. Case presentation:This article reports the case of a 34-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital with sore throat, dizziness, and reduced sweating on the left side of her body. Physical examination found herpes lesions on the left upper lip and left external ear canal (scabbed) and reduced sweating on the left side of the body. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed no abnormalities. After a lumbar puncture, the patient was diagnosed with viral meningitis by VZV infection. The electromyographic skin sympathetic reflex indicated damage to the left sympathetic nerve. Conclusions:Secondary unilateral sweating reduction is a rare neurological complication of herpes zoster, caused by damage to the autonomic nervous system. Literature review and comprehensive examination indicated that the reduced unilateral sweating was due to the activation of latent herpes zoster virus in the autonomic ganglia which has damaged the autonomic nervous system. For patients who exhibit acute hemibody sweat reduction, doctors should consider the possibility of secondary autonomic nervous system damage caused by herpes zoster.",

        "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance:The genus Scorzonera L. comprises of approximately 175 species, which are mainly distributed in temperate and arid regions of Central Europe, Central Asia, and Africa. Twenty-nine Scorzonera traditional ethnomedicines have been used for treating colds and fevers, pulmonary diseases, asthma, dyspepsia, malignant stomach neoplasia, liver disorder, jaundice, kidney diseases, mastitis, women's vaginitis, herpes zoster, poisonous ulcers, rheumatic pain, diabetic, atherosclerosis, headache, hypertension, dysentery, pregnant vomiting, snakebites, etc. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to systematically evaluate the genus Scorzonera over its ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology, discuss the relationship between traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological properties, and put forward some suggestions to promote further development and utilization of Scorzonera. Materials and methods:This review is based on published scientific research works obtained from the following databases: Elsevier, Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, Google Scholar, CNKI, Baidu Scholar, ResearchGate, and others (the Flora of China, 1997 edition; Chinese herbal books, PhD dissertation and Master thesis in Chinese). Results:The genus 81 Scorzonera plants have been studied for their traditional usage, phytochemistry, and pharmacology. Altogether 421 chemical constituents are isolated from the 54 species of Scorzonera, which include sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenoids, steroids, quinic acid derivatives, flavonoids, cumarinoids, lignanoids, phenylpropanoids, stilbene derivatives, benzylphthalides, kava lactones, phenolics, aliphatic acids, phthalic acids, alkanes, vitamins, sugars, alkaloids, and other constitutes. Besides those listed above, there are also volatile oils, polysaccharides, tannins, amino acids, enzymes, and inorganic elements. The extracts and compounds extracted from 55 Scorzonera species exhibit extensive pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, wound healing, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, anti-microbial, anti-ulcerogenic, antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, repairing cerebral ischemia, antidepressant, immunomodulatory activities, enzyme inhibitory effects, etc. Clinical applications strongly indicate that certain species are effective in treating herpes zoster and pregnancy resistance. Certain species are studied over applicationssuch as pharmacokinetic and histological distribution, and toxicity, the product extraction process, quick-freezing processing technology, synthesized metabolites, etc. Chemotaxonomy is also discussed on Scorzonera. Conclusion:This review provides information on traditional usage, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, chemotaxonomy, other applications aspects, and future prospects of the genus Scorzonera. However, only around one third of Scorzonera species have been studied so far. This review may be used as the basis for future endeavors, including further biological and chemical investigations, and efforts of seeking more applications.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster pharyngitis (HZP) is a rare condition that should be considered as a differential diagnosis of acute dysphagia secondary to unilateral glossopharyngeal and/or vagal nerve palsy. Although early treatment is important to avoid adverse sequelae, serological diagnosis of varicella zoster virus (VZV) takes over a few days. Therefore, it is important to actively suspect VZV infection based on physical findings. Mucocutaneous lesions, curtain signs, and laryngeal palsy are well-known characteristic physical findings. In addition to these findings, the video laryngeal endoscopic finding that the pharyngeal constrictor muscles contract on only one side during swallowing, showing an appearance of \"pharyngeal rotation\", is one of the characteristic findings of glossopharyngeal/vagal nerve palsy and can support the diagnosis. We report the case of an 82-year-old Asian female who presented with acute dysphagia, sore throat, left ear pain, and fever that persisted for several days. Initial video laryngeal endoscopy revealed a markedly decreased pharyngeal reflex and significant salivary retention without mucosal vesicular lesions. Repeat videoendoscopic evaluation of swallowing revealed characteristic pharyngeal rotation, which was helpful in diagnosing unilateral pharyngeal constrictor muscle paresis, thus suggesting unilateral glossopharyngeal/vagal nerve palsy. An increase in serum antibody titers (IgG and IgM) against VZV was observed. Bilateral differences and rotation of the pharynx during pharyngeal contraction can be detected endoscopically in pharyngeal constrictor muscle paresis caused by glossopharyngeal/vagal nerve palsy and should be evaluated during video laryngeal endoscopy in patients with dysphagia.",

        "abstract": "Background:Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation is the most common infectious complication in the late posthematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) period and is reported as 16%-41%. Acyclovir prophylaxis is recommended for at least 1 year after HSCT to prevent VZV infections. However, studies on the most appropriate prophylaxis are ongoing in pediatric patients. Methods:Patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT between January 1, 1996 and January 1, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed to outline the characteristics of VZV reactivation after allogeneic HSCT in pediatric patients using 6 months acyclovir prophylaxis. Results:There were 260 patients and 273 HSCTs. Median age was 10.43 (0.47-18.38), and 56% was male. Median follow-up was 2325 days (18-7579 days). VZV reactivation occurred in 21.2% (n = 58) at a median of 354 (55-3433) days post-HSCT. The peak incidence was 6-12 months post-HSCT (43.1%). Older age at HSCT, female gender, history of varicella infection, lack of varicella vaccination, low lymphocyte, CD4 count, and CD4/CD8 ratio at 9 and 12 months post-HSCT was found as a significant risk for herpes zoster (HZ) in univariate analysis, whereas history of varicella infection and low CD4/CD8 ratio at 12 months post-HSCT was an independent risk factor in multivariate analysis. Conclusions:Tailoring acyclovir prophylaxis according to pre-HCT varicella history, posttransplant CD4 T lymphocyte counts and functions, and ongoing immunosuppression may help to reduce HZ-related morbidity and mortality.",

Therefore, this study employs Mendelian randomization (MR) methodology to investigate the causal relationship between the two. Methods:This study selected 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of primary immunodeficiency-related genes as instrumental variables (IVs). Genetic associations of primary immunodeficiency-related genes were derived from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data on human plasma protein levels and circulating immune cells. Data on genes associated with varicella-zoster virus reactivation syndrome were obtained from the GWAS Catalog and FINNGEN database, primarily analyzed using inverse variance weighting (IVW) and sensitivity analysis. Results:Through MR analysis, we identified 9 primary immunodeficiency-related genes causally associated with herpes zoster and its subsequent neuralgia; determined causal associations of 20 primary immunodeficiency-related genes with three vascular lesions (stroke, cerebral aneurysm, giant cell arteritis); revealed causal associations of 10 primary immunodeficiency-related genes with two ocular diseases (retinopathy, keratitis); additionally, three primary immunodeficiency-related genes each were associated with encephalitis, cranial nerve palsy, and gastrointestinal infections. Conclusions:This study discovers a certain association between primary immunodeficiency-related genes and varicella-zoster virus reactivation syndrome, yet further investigations are warranted to explore the specific mechanisms underlying these connections.",

        "abstract": "Background:Globally, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and illness. Vaccine-preventable infections may increase acute coronary vascular disease events and the risk of complications. Low vaccine coverage has been reported among adults at high risk of complications from vaccine-preventable infections. There is a gap in research evidence around determinants of uptake of vaccines among adults with CVD. This study examined the uptake of influenza, pneumococcal and zoster vaccines and the determinants of uptake of the vaccines among cardiac patients. Method:A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out among hospitalised cardiac patients through an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to investigate self-reported uptake of influenza, pneumococcal and zoster vaccines. Univariate and multivariate analyses of participants' social demographic and clinical characteristics were conducted to identify factors for receiving influenza vaccine. Results:Low vaccination rates among 104 participants were found for influenza (45.2%), pneumococcal (13.5%) and zoster (5.8%) vaccines. The most common reason for not receiving influenza vaccine was concern about side effects. Lack of awareness about the pneumococcal and zoster vaccines was the main reason for the poor uptake of these vaccines. Australia-born participants were more likely to receive influenza vaccine than overseas-born participants. Working-age participants and, interestingly, people living with a current smoker were less likely to receive influenza vaccine. Conclusion:Influenza, pneumococcal and zoster vaccine uptake among cardiac patients was low. Encouraging physician recommendations for vaccination for cardiac patients under 65 years of age and addressing vaccination challenges among people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and pharmacy, workplace, and hospital vaccination may help increase vaccination uptake among cardiac patients.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims:Infections are a safety concern in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Etrasimod is an oral, once-daily (QD), selective sphingosine 1phosphate (S1P)1,4,5 receptor modulator for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. It leads to selective and reversible lymphocyte sequestration, and partial peripheral lymphocyte count decrease. We report infection events from the phase 3 ELEVATE program. Methods:Proportions, incidence rates (IRs; per 100 patient-years) and descriptive analyses of all, serious, severe, herpes zoster, and opportunistic infections are reported in the Pivotal UC cohort (ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12). Cox regression models evaluated potential baseline risk factors. Results:In this analysis (n=787), proportions (IRs) of all infection events were similar for patients receiving etrasimod 2 mg QD (18.8% [41.1]) or placebo (17.7% [49.0]). Serious infections occurred in three (0.6%) and five (1.9%) patients receiving etrasimod and placebo, respectively. Two herpes zoster events were reported in each group (etrasimod: 0.4%; placebo: 0.8%); all localized and non-serious. One opportunistic infection event was reported in each group. No patient with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) <0.2 × 109/L reported serious/severe or opportunistic infections; no baseline risk factors were identified for such events. No deaths occurred. Conclusions:Patients receiving etrasimod demonstrated no increased risk of infection. The incidence of serious infections and herpes zoster was similar in each group. Among patients receiving etrasimod, no association between ALC <0.5 × 109/L and infection events was observed. Longer-term follow-up will further characterize the etrasimod safety profile.",

        "abstract": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who receive immunosuppressive medications have a heightened risk of infection. The goal of our study was to calculate the pooled cumulative incidence and risk of infection in patients with RA treated with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi). The PubMed and EMBASE databases were queried for randomized controlled trials comparing patients with RA treated with JAKi (upadacitinib, baricitinib, tofacitinib, peficitinib, or filgotinib), defined as the treatment group, compared with control subjects, defined as participants receiving placebo or treatment regimen that was similar to that of participants in the treatment group, with the exception of JAKi. The primary study endpoint was the relative risk (RR) of any-grade and severe infection. The secondary endpoints were RR and cumulative incidence of opportunistic infections, herpes zoster, and pneumonia. The Stata v17 software was used for all data analysis. Results showed that treatment with baricitinib was associated with an increased risk of any-grade (RR 1.34; 95% CI: 1.19-1.52) and opportunistic (RR 2.69; 95% CI: 1.22-5.94) infection, whereas treatment with filgotinib (RR 1.21; 95% CI: 1.05-1.39), peficitinib (RR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.05-1.86) and upadacitinib (RR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.09-1.56) was associated with increased risk of any-grade infection only. Analysis based on type of infection showed a pooled cumulative incidence of 32.44% for any-grade infections, 2.02% for severe infections, 1.74% for opportunistic infections, 1.56% for herpes zoster, and 0.49% for pneumonia in patients treated with any JAKi during the follow-up period. Treatment with specific JAKi in patients with RA is associated with an increased risk of any-grade and opportunistic infections but not severe infection. Close clinical monitoring of patients with RA treated with JAKi is required to establish the long-term infection risk profile of these agents.",

        "abstract": "People with diabetes are at higher risk of serious complications from many vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Some studies have highlighted the potential impact of glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c), but no systematic review has synthesized these findings. Of the 823 identified studies, 3 were included, for a total of 705,349 participants. Regarding the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ), one study found that higher HbA1c levels at the baseline (>10.3%) were associated with a significantly higher risk of HZ of 44%, compared to those with a good HbA1c control (6.7%). On the contrary, the second one reported that when compared to the reference group (HbA1c of 5.0-6.4%), participants with a HbA1c less than 5.0% were at higher risk of HZ of 63%, whilst participants with a HBA1c more than 9.5% had a similar risk. Finally, the third study observed that diabetes, defined using a value of HbA1c more than 7.5%, was associated with an increased risk of mortality in men with COVID-19. In conclusion, both high and low HBA1c levels appear to be associated with a higher risk of HZ. Regarding COVID-19, a value of HbA1c more than 7.5% was associated with a higher risk of death in COVID-19, but only in men.",

        "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is associated with herpes zoster (HZ) or herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). All antiviral agents currently licensed for the management of VZV replication via modulating different mechanisms, and the resistance is on the rise. There is a need to develop new antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action and adequate safety profiles. Pralatrexate (PDX) is a fourth-generation anti-folate agent with an inhibitory activity on folate (FA) metabolism and has been used as an anti-tumor drug. We observed that PDX possessed potent inhibitory activity against VZV infection. In this study, we reported the antiviral effects and the underlying mechanism of PDX against VZV infection. The results showed that PDX not only inhibited VZV replication in vitro and in mice corneal tissues but also reduced the inflammatory response and apoptosis induced by viral infection. Furthermore, PDX treatment showed a similar anti-VSV inhibitory effect in both in vitro and in vivo models. Mechanistically, PDX inhibited viral replication by interrupting the substrate supply for de novo purine and thymidine synthesis. In conclusion, this study discovered the potent antiviral activity of PDX with a novel mechanism and presented a new strategy for VZV treatment that targets a cellular metabolic mechanism essential for viral replication. The present study provided a new insight into the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents.",

In addition, EBV rarely but occasionally causes central nervous system (CNS) complications.

Identification of EBV-infected peripheral blood cells revealed a predominance of B cells. Notably, intravenous rituximab ameliorated EBV reactivation and TM. Since the CNS infiltration rate of intravenous rituximab is markedly low, the clinical efficacy of rituximab against TM suggests that EBV reactivation may cause TM via immune-mediated mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Background:Eczema herpeticum is a rapidly progressing skin complication related to the herpes simplex virus, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems or atopic dermatitis. Eczema herpeticum is characterized by cutaneous pain, scaling, and the presence of vesicular lesions, often accompanied by secondary infection. Dissemination of the infection can lead to severe morbidity and mortality in patients without appropriate antiviral and antibiotic therapy. Case report:We presented a case of ankylosing spondylitis in a relatively young patient who did not receive immunosuppressive therapy and had no history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, herpes zoster infection or atopic dermatitis. The patient's symptoms improved following a course of antiviral and antibiotic treatments. Introduction:The incidence of eczema herpeticum has been on the rise in recent decades, primarily due to an increased number of individuals with compromised immune systems. This increase can be attributed to various factors, including the higher prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the more extensive use of immunosuppressive therapy, and what seems to be a growing incidence of atopic dermatitis.[1] This disease can be initially mistaken for Stevens-Johnson syndrome because of the rapid advancement of skin lesions, however, the atypical target lesions, flaccid bullae and prominent mucosal involvement found in Stevens-Johnson syndrome are absent in cases of eczema herpeticum. Other differential diagnoses include impetigo, disseminated herpes zoster, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, dermatitis herpetiformis.",

        "abstract": "Viral keratitis is a significant cause of ocular morbidity and visual impairment worldwide. In recent years, there has been a growing understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic modalities for viral keratitis. The most common viral pathogens associated with this condition are adenovirus, herpes simplex (HSV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). However, emerging viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Vaccinia virus can also cause keratitis. Non-surgical interventions are the mainstay of treatment for viral keratitis. Antiviral agents such as Acyclovir, Ganciclovir, and trifluridine have effectively reduced viral replication and improved clinical outcomes. Additionally, adjunctive measures such as lubrication, corticosteroids, and immunomodulatory agents have alleviated symptoms by reducing inflammation and facilitating tissue repair. Despite these conservative approaches, some cases of viral keratitis may progress to severe forms, leading to corneal scarring, thinning, or perforation. In such instances, surgical intervention becomes necessary to restore corneal integrity and visual function. This review article aims to provide an overview of the current perspectives and surgical interventions in managing viral keratitis. The choice of surgical technique depends on the extent and severity of corneal involvement. As highlighted in this article, on-going research and advancements in surgical interventions hold promise for further improving outcomes in patients with viral keratitis.",

        "abstract": "Background:Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and illness globally. Influenza, pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster infection may trigger acute cardiovascular events or cause complications among cardiac patients. Vaccination is recommended for adults with CVD. There is a gap in research evidence around determinants and uptake of influenza, pneumococcal and zoster vaccines in adults with CVD. Objective:The aim of this study is to examine the rate of the uptake of influenza, zoster and pneumococcal vaccines, factors associated with the uptake of influenza vaccine, and the perceptions of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among people with CVD in the community. Method:Cross-sectional survey data was analysed from three separate surveys carried out in Australia between October 2019 and September 2020 of 972 adults with CVD. We used descriptive statistics to describe data. Thematic analysis examined the reasons for taking influenza vaccine. Multivariable analysis was used to identify independent predictors of the influenza vaccine uptake and perceptions associated with the uptake of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Results:Out of 972 participants, a total of 661 (68 %) people said they had received influenza vaccine in the last 12 months; 361 (37 %) had ever received pneumococcal vaccine; 196 (20 %) had ever received zoster vaccine. Among 661 participants who said they received influenza vaccine within the 12 months prior to the study, 543 (82 %) participants received it from doctors or general practitioners (GPs) offices. Age 65 and older, being born in Australia, being employed or retired and having comorbidity were positive predictors of influenza vaccination. Doctors' recommendations to take the vaccine and awareness of free vaccines positively predicted influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake. Conclusion:The uptake of recommended pneumococcal and zoster vaccines is low in people with CVD. Doctors' recommendations, targeted health promotion programs in general practice, and easy access to vaccination may optimise vaccination uptake in patients with CVD.",

        "abstract": "Background:Up to 1/3 of patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) may develop ophthalmoplegia. Although zoster-related ophthalmoplegia (ZO) is typically treated with antiviral agents, there is controversy regarding the therapeutic role of systemic steroids. Methods:This was a retrospective case series and case report-based systematic review. For the case series, participants were recruited from tertiary neuro-ophthalmology clinics. Eligible participants were those who developed cranial nerve palsies (CNP) within 1 month of HZO diagnosis. In the systematic review, all adults with ZO in the literature who were treated with antivirals or steroids only, or combination therapy were included. Main outcomes were initial presentation, investigations, neuroimaging, treatment regimen, and final outcomes of ophthalmoplegia. Results:Eleven immunocompetent patients with ZO were included. The most common CNP was CN III (5/11), followed by CN VI (2/11) and CN IV (2/11). One patient had multiple CNPs. All patients were treated with antivirals, and 4 also treated with a short course of oral steroids. At 6-month follow-up, 75% of patients treated with combination therapy and 85.7% treated with antivirals alone had complete recovery of ZO. The systematic review identified 63 studies consisting of 76 cases of ZO. When comparing patients treated with antivirals with those treated with antivirals and steroids, patients on combination therapy had more severe ocular findings, including complete ophthalmoplegia ( P < 0.001). Age was the only significant predictor of complete recovery of ophthalmoplegia on multivariable logistic regression ( P = 0.037). Conclusions:The rate of complete recovery in immunocompetent patients with ZO was similar in patients treated with antivirals alone vs those treated with antivirals and oral steroids. The systematic literature review affirmed these findings. However, age may influence recovery of ophthalmoplegia.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:The Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS) is a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) funded by the National Eye Institute aiming to determine the efficacy of suppressive valacyclovir treatment in herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) that enrolled fewer participants than planned (527/780, 67.6%). Understanding reasons for nonparticipation of likely eligible prescreened patients provides insights into patient populations that are not represented by ZEDS and barriers in clinical trials. Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, HZO adults likely eligible for ZEDS with a history of a typical rash and a medical record within the past year of an episode of epithelial or stromal keratitis or iritis were prescreened at activated Participating Clinical Centers from 2017 to 2022 using a standard prescreening log. De-identified data including demographic information, reasons for exclusion because of ineligibility, and patient refusal were retrospectively entered into REDCap and analyzed. Results:Prescreening logs with reasons for nonconsent (1244/1706, 72.9%) were included in the data set. Patients were excluded from the study (915/1244, 73.6%) because they did not meet all inclusion criteria (619/915, 67.7%) or met an exclusion criterion (296/915, 32.3%). Among the 12 exclusion criteria for the ZEDS study, immunocompromise (76/296, 25.7%) and renal insufficiency (50/296, 16.9%) were most frequently reported. Patient refusal to participate (327/1,244, 26.3%) was common. Conclusion:The most common reasons for ineligibility were immunocompromise and renal insufficiency. There may be benefits to long-term antiviral use in these populations not captured in ZEDS. A quarter (26.3%) of prescreened patients refused participation, showing the substantial impact of patient preferences on trial participation.",

        "abstract": "Patients infected with herpes zoster might be at risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, antiviral drugs may impede viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. This study aimed to determine whether the currently observed association between herpes zoster and PD is consistent with previous findings, and whether antiviral drug use is associated with PD. This retrospective cohort study used the Longitudinal Generation Tracking Database. We included patients aged 40 years and above and applied propensity score matching at 1:1 ratio for study comparability. PD risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression methods. A total of 234,730 people were analyzed. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for PD in patients with herpes zoster was 1.05. Furthermore, the overall incidence of PD was lower in those treated with antiviral drugs than in the untreated ones (3.17 vs. 3.76 per 1,000 person-years); the aHR was 0.84. After stratifying for sex or age, a similar result was observed. In conclusion, herpes zoster may increase the risk of PD, particularly among females, but receiving antiviral treatment reduces the risk by 16%. Therefore, using antiviral drugs may help prevent PD. However, additional research is required to determine the underlying mechanism(s).",

        "abstract": "As a common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the adverse reactions of TNF-α inhibitors (TNFis) in practical application have garnered attention. This study aims to investigate the adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with TNFi in RA patients as reported in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, to offer insights for clinical use. Cases related to RA and primarily involving TNFi were extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and compared by gender stratification. Screening was conducted based on reporting odds ratio and information component to identify positive ADEs for different TNFis and evaluate common and unique ADEs among various TNFis. There are 4 common ADEs among TNFis, including pulmonary tuberculosis, infection, hypersensitivity, and herpes zoster, as described in the package inserts. However, each TNFi has unique positive ADEs. Adalimumab has 63 unique positive ADEs, including lower respiratory tract inflammation, systemic lupus erythematosus rash, vascular dementia, ovarian neoplasm, adhesion, sarcoma, coccidioidomycosis, etc. Golimumab has 6 unique positive ADEs, including pneumonia cryptococcal, device deployment issue, pneumonia bacterial, polyneuropathy, device malfunction, device issue, etc; certolizumab has 24 unique positive ADEs, including maternal exposure before pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes, exposure via breast milk, staphylococcal sepsis, erysipelas, low birth weight baby, herpes virus infection, premature delivery, etc; etanercept has 180 unique positive ADEs, including joint destruction, chondrolysis, finger deformity, ankle deformity, joint warmth, etc; infliximab has 60 unique positive ADEs, including Hodgkin's disease, metastatic neoplasm, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, etc. Although the aforementioned 5 TNFis share common ADEs such as herpes zoster, clinicians must exercise caution when selecting specific medications, especially for RA patients concurrently suffering from malignancies. The analysis indicates that infliximab is associated with 60 unique positive ADEs, including Hodgkin's disease, metastatic neoplasm, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; therefore, these patients should use infliximab with greater caution. Similarly, certolizumab should be used with increased caution in pregnant and postpartum women.",

        "title": "Glycoprotein E-Displaying Nanoparticles Induce Robust Neutralizing Antibodies and T-Cell Response against Varicella Zoster Virus",
        "abstract": "The Varicella zoster virus (VZV), responsible for both varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles), presents significant global health challenges. While primary VZV infection primarily affects children, leading to chickenpox, reactivation in later life can result in herpes zoster and associated post-herpetic neuralgia, among other complications. Vaccination remains the most effective strategy for VZV prevention, with current vaccines largely based on the attenuated vOka strains. Although these vaccines are generally effective, they can induce varicella-like rashes and have sparked concerns regarding cell virulence. As a safer alternative, subunit vaccines circumvent these issues. In this study, we developed a nanoparticle-based vaccine displaying the glycoprotein E (gE) on ferritin particles using the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system, termed FR-gE. This FR-gE nanoparticle antigen elicited substantial gE-specific binding and VZV-neutralizing antibody responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice-responses that were up to 3.2-fold greater than those elicited by the subunit gE while formulated with FH002C, aluminum hydroxide, or a liposome-based XUA01 adjuvant. Antibody subclass analysis revealed that FR-gE produced comparable levels of IgG1 and significantly higher levels of IgG2a compared to subunit gE, indicating a Th1-biased immune response. Notably, XUA01-adjuvanted FR-gE induced a significant increase in neutralizing antibody response compared to the live attenuated varicella vaccine and recombinant vaccine, Shingrix. Furthermore, ELISPOT assays demonstrated that immunization with FR-gE/XUA01 generated IFN-γ and IL-2 levels comparable to those induced by Shingrix. These findings underscore the potential of FR-gE as a promising immunogen for the development of varicella and herpes zoster vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Background:Diffuse connective tissue diseases (DCTDs) require long-term immunosuppressive treatment, increasing the risk of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. This study aims to evaluate the humoral immune status against VZV in DCTD patients and explore factors that may influence their immune levels. Methods:This is a retrospective cohort study that collected data from adult DCTD patients (≥18 years) attending our outpatient clinic. The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of VZV-specific IgG antibodies in the patients' sera was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results:A total of 280 RA patients, 272 SLE + MCTD patients and 280 healthy controls were included. SLE + MCTD patients had significantly higher VZV IgG antibody levels than RA patients (p< 0.05) but showed no significant difference compared to healthy controls (p> 0.05). Notable differences were observed particularly among female patients and those aged 30-49 years, (p< 0.05). SLE + MCTD patients in an active disease state had significantly higher VZV IgG antibody titers than RA patients (p< 0.05). Additionally, patients with a history of herpes zoster, regardless of being in the SLE + MCTD, RA, or control group, exhibited higher VZV IgG titers (p< 0.05). Conclusion:Although DCTD patients, particularly those with SLE and MCTD, exhibit higher VZV IgG antibody levels, they still face a higher risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ), which may be related to their underlying disease and immunosuppressive treatment. The presence of antibodies alone may not provide complete protection, necessitating consideration of cellular immune mechanisms. It is recommended to enhance monitoring of VZV antibody levels in high-risk patients and consider herpes zoster vaccination to reduce HZ-related complications.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, remains a significant global health issue and most commonly seen in elderly individuals with an early exposure history to varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Currently, the licensed vaccine Shingrix, which comprises a recombinant VZV glycoprotein E (gE) formulated with a potent adjuvant AS01B, is the most effective shingles vaccine on the market. However, undesired reactogenicity and increasing global demand causing vaccine shortage, prompting the development of novel shingles vaccines. Here, we developed novel vaccine candidates utilising multiple nanoparticle (NP) platforms to display the recombinant gE antigen, formulated in an MF59-biosimilar adjuvant. In naïve mice, all tested NP vaccines induced higher humoral and cellular immune responses than Shingrix, among which, the gEM candidate induced the highest cellular response. In live attenuated VZV (VZV LAV)-primed mouse and rhesus macaque models, the gEM candidate elicited superior cell-mediated immunity (CMI) over Shingrix. Collectively, we demonstrated that NP technology remains a suitable tool for developing shingles vaccine, and the reported gEM construct is a highly promising candidate in the next-generation shingles vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "Background:The introduction of varicella vaccines into routine pediatric immunization programs has led to a considerable reduction in varicella incidence. However, there have been reports of varicella, herpes zoster, and meningitis caused by the vaccine strain of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), raising concerns. Establishing the relationship between the wild-type and vaccine strains in VZV infections among previously vaccinated individuals is crucial. Differences in the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among vaccine strains can be utilized to identify the strain. In this study, we employed nanopore sequencing to identify VZV strains and analyzed clinical samples. Methods:We retrospectively examined vesicle and cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with VZV infections. One sample each of the wild-type and vaccine strains, previously identified using allelic discrimination real-time PCR and direct sequencing, served as controls. Ten samples with undetermined VZV strains were included. After DNA extraction, a long PCR targeting the VZV ORF62 region was executed. Nanopore sequencing identified SNPs, allowing discrimination between the vaccine and wild-type strains. Results:Nanopore sequencing confirmed SNPs at previously reported sites (105,705, 106,262, 107,136, and 107,252), aiding in distinguishing between wild-type and vaccine strains. Among the ten unknown samples, nine were characterized as wild strains and one as a vaccine strain. Even in samples with low VZV DNA levels, nanopore sequencing was effective in strain identification. Conclusion:This study validates that nanopore sequencing is a reliable method for differentiating between the wild-type and vaccine strains of VZV. Its ability to produce long-read sequences is remarkable, allowing simultaneous confirmation of known SNPs and the detection of new mutations. Nanopore sequencing can serve as a valuable tool for the swift and precise identification of wild-type and vaccine strains and has potential applications in future VZV surveillance.",

Atypical presentations, including hemorrhagic, necrotizing, and bullous forms, can complicate diagnosis and lead to delays in appropriate treatment. We present a case of a disseminated bullous VZV infection in an immunocompromised patient with cancer. The patient, initially misdiagnosed with bullous pemphigoid, was treated with oral steroids. The patient's condition progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and she ultimately succumbed to the infection. This case underscores the importance of considering VZV as a differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients presenting with bullous lesions. Early recognition and appropriate antiviral therapy are crucial for improving outcomes and preventing severe complications.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:To compare the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), cancer and infective complications in RA patients using Janus kinase (JAKis) and TNF (TNFis) inhibitors. Method:A retrospective analysis of data from the Hong Kong Biologics Registry 2008-2021 was performed. RA patients who had ever used JAKis or TNFis were included. The incidence of MACEs, cancer and infections were compared between the two groups, with adjustment for confounding factors. Results:A total of 2471 courses of JAKis (n = 551) and TNFis (n = 1920) were used in 1732 RA patients (83.7% women, age 53.8 [12.5] years; follow-up 6431 patient-years). JAKi users had significantly older age, more atherosclerotic risk factors and higher frequency of past malignancies. A total of 15 and 40 MACEs developed in the JAKi and TNFi users, respectively (incidence 1.34 vs 0.75 per 100 patient-years; P = 0.22). There was no significant difference in the incidence of cancers between the two groups (0.81 [JAKi] vs 0.85 [TNFi] per 100 patient-years; P = 0.25). The adjusted hazard ratios of MACE and cancer in the JAKi users were 1.36 (95% CI: 0.62, 2.96) (P = 0.44) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.39, 1.95) (P = 0.74), respectively. Rates of infections were significantly higher in the JAKi than TNFi users (16.3 vs 9.9 per 100 patient-years; P = 0.02), particularly herpes zoster (3.49 vs 0.94 per 100 patient-years; P < 0.001). Conclusions:In a real-life setting, there is no increase in MACEs or cancers in users of JAKis compared with TNFis. However, the incidence of non-serious infections, including herpes zoster, was increased in users of JAKis.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Several vaccine-related cutaneous adverse events occurred following the widespread use of vaccines to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This case series reports 25 patients with de novo or accentuated dermatologic conditions after receiving the Sinopharm, Sputnik V, AstraZeneca, or BIV1-CovIran vaccine in Iran. Methods and results:Twenty-five eligible patients with a mean age of 46.80 years were investigated. The cutaneous adverse events included pityriasis rosea, zoster, viral exanthema, urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. The manifestations appeared 14.45 ± 6.98 and 20.79 ± 22.18 days following injection of the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. All patients experienced new cases of cutaneous disease other than two who developed flare-ups of lichen planus and psoriasis. Conclusion:Several cutaneous reactions, ranging from allergic events to skin diseases, have been reported following the injection of COVID-19 vaccines. Focal injection-site reactions are the most common cutaneous adverse events; however, de-novo skin diseases and a flare-up of preexisting cutaneous disorders have also been described. Although many cases of COVID-19 vaccine-related cutaneous diseases have been published, our zoster/lichen planus and AGEP cases after vaccination are interesting. A more detailed understanding of cutaneous adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination will facilitate better diagnosis and management.",

        "abstract": "Background:Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with varicella immunoglobulin is recommended to minimize risk of varicella complications for high-risk children. However, providers frequently use alternatives like acyclovir or intravenous immunoglobulin. Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted of PEP for varicella in children from January 2009 to December 2019. Data were provided by 47 children's hospitals who participate in the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Patients with clinical encounters for varicella exposure were reviewed. Choice of varicella PEP regimens, including differences by underlying condition and institution, and incidence of varicella disease were determined. Results:A total of 1704 patients with first clinical encounters for varicella met inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 509 (29.9%) were prescribed PEP after varicella exposure, and 65 (3.8%) ultimately had a subsequent encounter for varicella disease. Of 509 patients who received PEP, acyclovir was most frequently prescribed (n = 195, 38.3%), followed by varicella immunoglobulin (n = 146, 28.7%), IVIG (n = 115, 22.6%), and combination therapy (n = 53, 10.4%). The highest proportion of varicella immunoglobulin use (10/20, 50%) was amongst children with diagnoses of rheumatological/gastrointestinal conditions. The highest proportion of acyclovir use (29/684, 4.2%) was amongst children with diagnoses of oncology/stem cell transplant conditions. The proportion of patients who subsequently had clinical encounters for varicella disease was highest for Acyclovir (30/195, 15.4%) followed by varicella immunoglobulin (5/146, 3.4%), combination therapy (2/53, 3.8%), and intravenous immunoglobulin alone (0/115) (P < .0001). Conclusions:Varicella PEP in high-risk children was highly varied among children's hospitals. In our dataset, use of acyclovir was associated with a higher rate of subsequent encounters for Varicella disease.",

        "abstract": "Background:Systematic treatment with intravenous acyclovir is usually given when varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA is isolated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), indicating central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Our study aimed to describe therapeutic management and acute kidney injury (AKI) occurrence during acyclovir treatment of VZV infection with CNS involvement. Methods:Multicentre, retrospective study including all patients from 2010 to 2022 with VZV DNA in CSF. Patient management and outcomes were compared according to clinical presentation and indications for intravenous acyclovir: i) definite (encephalitis, myelitis or stroke, peripheral nervous system (PNS) with ≥ 2 roots, herpes zoster ≥ 3 dermatomes, immunosuppression), ii) questionable (1 or 2 dermatomes) or iii) no indication (other situations). Results:154 patients were included (median age 66 (interquartile range 43-77), 87 (56%) males); 60 (39%) had encephalitis, myelitis or stroke, 35 (23%) had PNS involvement, 37 (24%) had isolated meningitis, 14 (9%) had isolated cutaneous presentation, and 8 (5%) had other presentations. Overall, 128 (83%) received intravenous acyclovir for more than 72 h. AKI occurred in 57 (37%) patients. Finally, 42 (27%) and 25 (16%) patients had respectively no or a questionable indication for intravenous acyclovir, while 29 (69%) and 23 (92%) of them received it for more than 72 h, with AKI in 13 (35%) and 13 (52%) patients, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 12% (n= 18), and no deaths were reported in isolated meningitis. Conclusions:Intravenous acyclovir is widely prescribed when VZV DNA is isolated in CSF, regardless of the clinical presentation, with a high rate of AKI. Further studies are needed to better define the value of intravenous acyclovir in isolated VZV meningitis.",

There was no development of a cutaneous rash. An orbital biopsy demonstrated VZV infection, which was confirmed on a lumbar puncture. In this case, VZV meningoencephalitis was not responsive to steroid or antiviral therapy. This case highlights an atypical presentation of VZV with orbital myositis preceding intracranial involvement.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and its correlation underscore its impact on a significant segment of the population. Notably contagious, VZV serves as a risk factor for the manifestation of HIV/AIDS, with its reactivation often signaling the onset of immunodeficiency. Recognizing the concurrent existence of these two diseases, this study focuses on the co-infection dynamics through a deterministic mathematical model. The population is categorized into seven exclusive groups, considering the complexities arising from the interplay of HIV and Zoster. We establish the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions, examine equilibrium points, calculate basic reproduction numbers via the next-generation matrix approach, and analyze the existence and local stabilities of equilibriums using the Routh-Hurwitz stability criteria. The numerical simulations reveal that the model converges to an endemic equilibrium point when the reproduction number exceeds unity. The primary objectives of this study are to comprehensively understand the transmission dynamics of HIV and Zoster in a co-infected population and to provide valuable insights for developing effective intervention strategies. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing these co-infections to mitigate their impact on public health.",

        "abstract": "Although the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) for individuals aged 50 years and older, its effectiveness in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains uncertain. This study was conducted to assess the effect of RZV on the risk of HZ in COPD patients. A multi-institutional propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX Research network, including individuals aged 40 years or older with COPD from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022. Patients with a history of HZ or prior zoster vaccination were excluded. The primary outcome was HZ occurrence, with secondary outcomes including severe and nonsevere HZ. After propensity score matching, each 17 431 patients receiving RZV and unvaccinated patients were included. The vaccinated group had a significantly lower risk of HZ compared to the unvaccinated group (HR, 0.62; [95% confidence intervals] 95% CI, 0.51-0.75, p < 0.01). Similar risk reductions were observed for nonsevere HZ (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 049-0.75, p < 0.01) and severe HZ (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.73, p < 0.01). Further subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent risk reductions across age (50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years), sex, and comorbidities, except for individual aged 40-49 years. This study confirms the effectiveness of RZV in reducing HZ risk in patients with COPD aged 50 years and older, supporting its administration in this population. However, vaccination rates remain low, highlighting the need for improved vaccination strategies in this high-risk group. Efforts to enhance vaccine uptake are warranted to reduce HZ morbidity.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims:Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We report an integrated summary of tofacitinib safety from the completed global UC clinical program (9.2 years maximum tofacitinib exposure). Methods:This analysis included patients receiving tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) from completed phase 2/3 placebo-controlled studies, an open-label, long-term extension study and a randomized phase 3b/4 study. Proportions and incidence rates (IRs; unique patients with events/100 patient-years [PY] of exposure) were evaluated for deaths and adverse events (AEs) of special interest (AESI). Results:Overall, 1157 patients received ≥1 dose of tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg b.i.d.; 938 (81.1%) were in the predominant dose tofacitinib 10 mg b.i.d. group; 552 (47.7%) received tofacitinib for ≥2 years; total exposure: 3202.0 PY; 994 (85.9%) experienced AEs; 254 (22.0%) experienced serious AEs. Median treatment duration: 1.7 (range 0.0-9.2) years. IRs (95% CI) for combined tofacitinib doses: deaths 0.24 (0.10-0.48); serious infections (SIs) 1.80 (1.37-2.32); herpes zoster (HZ; non-serious and serious) 3.24 (2.63-3.94); serious HZ 0.24 (0.10-0.48); opportunistic infections 0.96 (0.65-1.36); malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) 0.88 (0.59-1.26); NMSC 0.71 (0.45-1.07); major adverse cardiovascular events 0.27 (0.12-0.52); deep vein thrombosis 0.06 (0.01-0.22); pulmonary embolism 0.18 (0.07-0.40); and gastrointestinal perforations 0.09 (0.02-0.27). Conclusions:Except for HZ and SIs, IRs for AESI were <1 case/100 PY. Safety was consistent with previous analyses of shorter exposure and tofacitinib's known safety profile, including real-world data.

        "abstract": "After primary infection, Varicella Zoster (VZV) persists in sensory dorsal root ganglia and may be reactivated in periods of diminished T-cell immunity. Varicella Zoster reactivation post allogenic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be challenging to diagnose as it does not always present with characteristic skin lesions. We describe a pediatric patient who presented with isolated severe abdominal pain with no other symptoms. Cutaneous lesions appeared only 10 days later resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. He was successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir and recovered after a prolonged hospital stay with post-herpetic neuralgia. Abdominal pain in children post HSCT has a broad differential and VZV reactivation should be considered even in absence of cutaneous lesions. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to reduce VZV-related morbidity and mortality. In this article we present a case report and review clinical presentation and outcome of similar cases in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives:Achieving adequate pain reduction in the acute phase of herpes zoster is essential for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). For this purpose, appropriate antiviral medications, oral analgesic medications, and various nerve block methods could be applied. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a simple, novel ultrasound-guided block technique, and its use has increased because the procedure is convenient and relatively safe. Although several cases have reported the zoster-associated pain (ZAP) control effect of ESPB, the efficacy of ESPB has not been compared with that of other types of nerve blocks for managing ZAP. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of ESPB with that of other types of nerve blocks for managing ZAP.Study Design:Retrospective case-control study.Materials and Methods:Medical records of 53 patients with acute thoracic herpes zoster were reviewed. We divided the participants into two groups: patients who received transforaminal epidural injection (TFEI) (n= 32) and those who received ESPB (n= 21). The efficacy of the procedure was assessed by a numerical rating scale (NRS) and by recording patient medication doses before the procedure and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months after the procedure.Results:The time required for pain intensity to decrease to NRS ≤ 2 was not significantly different between the groups. The rate of medication discontinuation also was not different between the groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of clinically significant PHN (NRS ≥ 3) at any time point.Limitations:The relatively small sample size from a single center and the retrospective nature of the study served as limitations.Conclusions:The clinical effects of ESPB and TFEI were similar in patients with acute thoracic herpes zoster. ESPB could be considered an interventional option for ZAP management.",

        "title": "Suppression of the host antiviral response by non-infectious varicella zoster virus extracellular vesicles",
        "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivates from ganglionic sensory neurons to produce herpes zoster (shingles) in a unilateral dermatomal distribution, typically in the thoracic region. Reactivation not only heightens the risk of stroke and other neurological complications but also increases susceptibility to co-infections with various viral and bacterial pathogens at sites distant from the original infection. The mechanism by which VZV results in complications remote from the initial foci remains unclear. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are membranous signaling structures that can deliver proteins and nucleic acids to modify the function of distal cells and tissues during normal physiological conditions. Although viruses have been documented to exploit the sEV machinery to propagate infection, the role of non-infectious sEVs released from VZV-infected neurons in viral spread and disease has not been studied. Using multi-omic approaches, we characterized the content of sEVs released from VZV-infected human sensory neurons (VZV sEVs). One viral protein was detected (immediate-early 62), as well as numerous immunosuppressive and vascular disease-associated host proteins and miRNAs that were absent in sEVs from uninfected neurons. Notably, VZV sEVs are non-infectious yet transcriptionally altered primary human cells, suppressing the antiviral type 1 interferon response and promoting neuroinvasion of a secondary pathogenin vivo. These results challenge our understanding of VZV infection, proposing that the virus may contribute to distant pathologies through non-infectious sEVs beyond the primary infection site. Furthermore, this study provides a previously undescribed immune-evasion mechanism induced by VZV that highlights the significance of non-infectious sEVs in early VZV pathogenesis. Importance:Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous human virus that predominantly spreads by direct cell-cell contact and requires efficient and immediate host immune evasion strategies to spread. The mechanisms of immune evasion prior to virion entry have not been fully elucidated and represent a critical gap in our complete understanding of VZV pathogenesis. This study describes a previously unreported antiviral evasion strategy employed by VZV through the exploitation of the infected host cell's small extracellular vesicle (sEV) machinery. These findings suggest that non-infectious VZV sEVs could travel throughout the body, affecting cells remote from the site of infection and challenging the current understanding of VZV clinical disease, which has focused on local effects and direct infection. The significance of these sEVs in early VZV pathogenesis highlights the importance of further investigating their role in viral spread and secondary disease development to reduce systemic complications following VZV infections.",

This research aimed to analyze the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) among cardiac healthcare professionals (HPs).Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a cardiological hospital in Italy. Multivariate regression models were built to identify factors associated with the outcomes of interest.Results: The response rate was 78.2% (154/197). Overall, age > 50 years and immunosuppression were recognized as risk factors for HZ by 38.3% and 75.3% of respondents, respectively. Regarding RZV, 29.1% of the HPs correctly responded about its schedule and 57.6% about the possibility of administration in immunocompromised individuals. This knowledge was significantly higher in HPs with a higher educational level (odds ratio (OR) = 4.42; 95%CI 1.70-11.47), in those who knew that HZ could cause postherpetic neuralgia (OR = 2.56; 95%CI 1.05-6.25) or major cardiovascular events (OR = 4.23; 95%CI 1.50-11.91), in those who had participated in professional updates on vaccinations (OR = 3.86; 95%CI 1.51-9.87) and in those who stated the need for further information about the RZV (OR = 6.43; 95%CI 1.42-29.98). Younger HPs (coefficient (β) = -0.02; 95%CI -0.04--0.01), those with a positive attitude toward RZV safety (β= 2.92; 95%CI 2.49-3.36) and those who had previously cared for patients with HZ (β= 0.45; 95%CI 0.03-0.88) reported a more positive attitude toward RZV effectiveness. The practice of recommending vaccination was more prevalent in younger HPs (OR = 0.94; 95%CI 0.89-0.99), in those who had a master's degree or higher education (OR = 7.21; 95%CI 1.44-36.08), in those with more positive attitudes toward RZV effectiveness (OR = 7.17; 95%CI 1.71-30.03) and in HPs who had already recommended the vaccine to patients in the past (OR = 4.03; 95%CI 1.08-14.96).Conclusions: Despite being a single-center study, our research brings attention to factors that currently impact cardiac HPs' approaches to RZV. The findings indicate potential measures to enhance HPs' awareness and practices, ultimately aiming to improve vaccination adherence and reduce the burden associated with HZ.",

Postherpetic abdominal pseudohernia is a rare sequela of the infection, caused by motor neuropathy with muscle paresis, that manifests as an abdominal protrusion. In patients receiving peritoneal dialysis who may often present slight abdominal distension, the diagnosis of this complication may be challenging. We present a case of this rare neurological complication in a patient on peritoneal dialysis and discuss its etiology and management.

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to provide practical recommendations on the management of pediatric patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies. The recommendations specifically address the cases of surgery, fever, and opportunistic infections (varicella, herpes-zoster, tuberculosis, invasive fungal disease). A qualitative approach was applied. A narrative literature review was performed via Medline. Primary searches were conducted using MeSH terms and free text to identify publications on infections and vaccinations in pediatric patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies. The results were presented and discussed in a nominal group meeting, comprising a committee of 12 pediatric rheumatologists from the Infection Prevention and Treatment Working Group of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Rheumatology. Several recommendations were generated. A consensus procedure was implemented via a Delphi process; this was extended to members of the Spanish Society of Pediatric Rheumatology and Spanish Society of Pediatric Infectious Disease of the Spanish Association of Pediatrics. Participants produced a score ranging from 0 (totally disagree) to 10 (totally agree). Agreement was defined as a vote ≥ 7 by at least 70% of participants. The literature review included more than 400 articles. Overall, 63 recommendations (19 on surgery, fever, and opportunistic infections) were generated and voted by 59 pediatric rheumatologists and other pediatric specialists. Agreement was reached for all 63 recommendations. The recommendations on special situations cover management in cases of surgery, fever, and opportunistic infections (varicella, herpes-zoster, tuberculosis, and invasive fungal disease). Conclusions: Hereby, we provided consensus and updated of recommendations about the management of special situations such as surgery, fever, and opportunistic in children with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive therapies. Several of the recommendations depend largely on clinical judgement and specific balance between risk and benefit for each individual and situation. To assess this risk, the clinician should have knowledge of the drugs, the patient's previous situation as well as the current infectious disease, in addition to experience. What is Known: • Infectious diseases and related complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases. • Information on how to manage the treatment in situations of fever, opportunistic infections, and surgery in children is limited, and guidelines for action are often extrapolated from adults. What is New: • In the absence of strong evidence, a literature review and a Delphi survey were conducted to establish a series of expert recommendations that could support the clinical practice, providing a practical and simple day-to-day approach to be used by pediatric rheumatologists.",

        "abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, causes varicella in primary infections and establishing a latent stage in sensory ganglia. Upon reactivation, VZV causes herpes zoster with severe neuralgia, especially in elderly patients. The mutation rate for VZV is comparatively lower than the other members of other alpha herpesviruses. Due to geographic isolation, different genotypes of VZV are circulating on separate continents. Here, we successfully isolated a VZV from the vesicular fluid of a youth zoster patient. Based on the single-nucleotide polymorphism profiles of different open reading frames that define the genotype, this newly isolated VZV primarily represents genotype clade 2 but also has characteristics of genotype clade 1. The next-generation sequencing provided a nearly full-length sequence, and further phylogenetic analysis revealed that this VZV isolate is distinct from clades 1 and 2. The Recombination Detection Program indicates that a possible recombinant event may occur between the VZV isolate and clade 1. In summary, we found that there is a circulating VZV isolate in China that may represent a recombinant between clade 1 and clade 2, providing new concerns that need to be considered in the future VZV vaccination program.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes Zoster in humans is the result of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection. Injecting rats with varicella zoster virus produces pain similar to herpes zoster \"shingles\" pain in humans. . In a previous study, orofacial pain was induced by injecting the whisker pad of male rats with VZV and the pain response increased after attenuating neurexin 3 (Nrxn3) expression in the central amygdala. Neurons descend from the central amygdala to the lateral parabrachial nucleus and orofacial pain signals ascend to the lateral parabrachial nucleus. GABAergic neurons within the central amygdala regulate pain by inhibiting activity within the lateral parabrachial nucleus. Attenuating Nrxn3 expression in the central amygdala increased GABA release in the lateral parabrachial nucleus suggesting Nrxn3 controls pain by regulating GABA release. Nrxn3 can also control synaptic connections between neurons, and we hypothesized that Nrxn3 knockdown in the central amygdala would reduce the number of GABAergic synaptic connections in the lateral parabrachial nucleus and increase VZV associated pain. Methods:To test this idea, the number of synaptic connections between GABAergic cells of the central amygdala and excitatory or dynorphin positive neurons within the lateral parabrachial nucleus were quantitated after infusion of a virus expressing synaptophysin. Synaptophysin is a synaptic vesicle protein that labels neuronal synaptic connections. These connections were measured in rats with and without whisker pad injection of VZV and knockdown of Nrxn3 within the central amygdala. Orofacial pain was measured using a place escape avoidance paradigm. Results:GABAergic synaptic connections were reduced in the lateral parabrachial nucleus after Nrxn3 knockdown. Rats with a reduction in the number of connections had an increase in VZV associated orofacial pain. Immunostaining with the pain marker prodynorphin indicated that the reduction in GABAergic connections was primarily associated with prodynorphin positive neurons. Discussion:The results suggest Nrxn3 reduces VZV associated orofacial pain, in part, by enhancing synaptic connections between GABA cells of the central amygdala and pain neurons within the lateral parabrachial nucleus.",

        "title": "Impaired STING Activation Due to a Variant in the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase AMFR in a Patient with Severe VZV Infection and Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis",
        "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus exclusively infecting humans, causing two distinct pathologies: varicella (chickenpox) upon primary infection and herpes zoster (shingles) following reactivation. In susceptible individuals, VZV can give rise to more severe clinical manifestations, including disseminated infection, pneumonitis, encephalitis, and vasculopathy with stroke. Here, we describe a 3-year-old boy in whom varicella followed a complicated course with thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic and necrotic lesions, pneumonitis, and intermittent encephalopathy. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was strongly suspected and as the condition deteriorated, HLH therapy was initiated. Although the clinical condition improved, longstanding hemophagocytosis followed despite therapy. We found that the patient carries a rare monoallelic variant in autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR), encoding a ubiquitin ligase involved in innate cytosolic DNA sensing and interferon (IFN) production through the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of IFN genes (cGAS-STING) pathway. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the patient exhibited impaired signaling downstream of STING in response dsDNA and 2'3'-cGAMP, agonists of cGAS and STING, respectively, and fibroblasts from the patient showed impaired type I IFN responses and significantly increased VZV replication. Overexpression of the variant AMFR R594C resulted in decreased K27-linked STING ubiquitination compared to WT AMFR. Moreover, ImageStream technology revealed reduced STING trafficking from ER to Golgi in cells expressing the patient AMFR R594C variant. This was supported by a dose-dependent dominant negative effect of expression of the patient AMFR variant as measured by IFN-β reporter gene assay. Finally, lentiviral transduction with WT AMFR partially reconstituted 2'3'-cGAMP-induced STING-mediated signaling and ISG expression in patient PBMCs. This work links defective AMFR-STING signaling to severe VZV disease and hyperinflammation and suggests a direct role for cGAS-STING in the control of viral infections in humans. In conclusion, we describe a novel genetic etiology of severe VZV disease in childhood, also representing the first inborn error of immunity related to a defect in the cGAS-STING pathway.",

The pattern of skin lesions and other variables were assessed. Results:The study included 303 patients, with 127 males and 176 females. Maculopapular rash was the predominant new cutaneous manifestation (54.92%), mainly in middle-aged individuals. Other findings included urticaria (16.39%), herpes zoster (11.89%), and herpes simplex (4.10%), vesicular rashes (2.46%), purpura (2.05%), erythema multiforme (1.64%), livedo reticularis (0.41%) and so on. Severe disease was associated with herpes zoster and livedo reticularis. Critical COVID-19 cases were linked to vesicular rashes, purpura, and erythema multiforme. The mean time for skin lesion emergence post-infection varied from 3 days for seborrheic dermatitis to 17.48 days for herpes zoster. Vasculitic manifestations correlated with elevated D-dimer levels. A total of 59 cases (19.47%) of recurrent or aggravated skin diseases were reported following infection with COVID-19, with dermatitis being the most common, followed by acne and folliculitis, psoriasis, urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, tinea corporis and androgenetic alopecia. Conclusion:The cutaneous phenotypes delineated in this study expand the dermatologic spectrum associated with COVID-19. Cutaneous manifestations may result from overactive immune responses, complement activation, and microvascular damage. Herpes zoster typically occurs in elderly COVID-19 patients with weaker immune systems or more severe diseases. Purpura and livedo reticularis, although rare, may indicate disease severity. It is possible to predict the course of COVID-19 with different severity through cutaneous manifestations. Recognizing these skin manifestations could aid in predicting COVID-19 severity and guide dermatologists in managing the pandemic response.",

At present, there is no specific treatment for HZ, and the mosteffective HZ control is vaccination. The main obstacle to developing an effective HZ vaccine is poorly induced cellular immune response. In this study, the IFN-α-gE-Fc fusion protein induced higher levels of humoral and cellular immunity compared to the unengineered gE antigen and higher levels of cellular immunity compared to the flagellin-gE-Fc fusion protein in a murine model. Compared with the marketed recombinant herpes zoster vaccine (Shingrix), IFN-α-gE-Fc can replace current used MPL adjuvant. At the same time, the immunogenicity of the IFN-α-gE-Fc + AQ was not weaker than that of the marketed recombinant zoster vaccine. The novel fusion protein provides a candidate entity for the development of a safe and effective novel HZ vaccine.",

        "abstract": "Herpes zoster (HZ) is an infectious disease caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), with 68% of cases occurring in adults over 50 years of age. HZ/su (Shingrix®) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for the prevention of HZ in individuals ≥ 50 years of age and showed very good protection from HZ. However, due to the use of the adjuvant AS01B, adverse reactions caused by Shingrix are a concern. Aluminum hydroxide is the most commonly used adjuvant and is widely used in a variety of vaccines. We developed a recombinant zoster vaccine (code: LZ901) consisting of a tetramer of VZV glycoprotein E (gE) and a human Fc fusion protein expressed in CHO cells, an immune complex-like molecule that can be adsorbed with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. We compared the immunogenicity of LZ901 with that of HZ/su in BALB/c mice. The results showed that LZ901 induced levels of gE-specific IgG antibodies comparable to those induced by HZ/su, and the results of FAMA titers further demonstrated their similar neutralizing antibody abilities. Most importantly, LZ901 induced higher levels of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (which plays a decisive role in the efficacy of zoster vaccines) than HZ/su in BALB/c mice. The numbers of cytokine-producing T cells in LZ901-vaccinated mice were significantly greater than those in v-vaccinated mice, and the proportions of CD4+and CD8+T cells producing at least two types of cytokines in LZ901-vaccinated mice were significantly greater than those in HZ/su-vaccinated mice.",

        "abstract": "Varicella vaccine was first licensed in Japan and South Korea in 1989 for use in healthy children and was introduced in US in 1995. So far, 29 countries have adopted varicella vaccine in their universal immunization program (UIP). No Asian country, India included, has adopted the varicella vaccine as part of their UIP. The extra-cutaneous sites for VZV diseases are central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, the expanded disease spectrum includes vasculopathy, myelitis, inflammatory bowel disease, perforated ulcers, and gastritis. The actual disease burden of varicella is not known as most of the infected individuals may not visit the physician. The amplifiable VZV DNA will not always be detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples in protracted illnesses such as vasculopathies, but demonstrable anti-VZV IgG in CSF has diagnostic value. The World Health Organization (WHO) position paper 2014 recommends two doses of varicella and zoster vaccines in targeted population. In India, varicella vaccine is not included in the UIP due to the cost and the belief that lifelong immunity occurs following primary infection. The expanded spectrum of VZV disease and the mounting body of evidence, however, suggest the need for both varicella and zoster vaccines in routine immunization schedule.",

        "abstract": "Background:Immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases such as shingles and pneumococcal disease is especially pertinent among older Canadians. However, vaccine uptake remains low. Data and methods:Data from the Canadian Health Survey on Seniors (CHSS) - 2019/2020 were used to examine receipt of shingles and pneumococcal vaccines among Canadians aged 65 and older living in the community. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify individual predisposing, enabling and needs-related factors associated with receipt of each type of vaccination. Reasons reported for not getting vaccinated were also examined. Results:Based on the 2019/2020 CHSS, an estimated 36.3% of Canadians aged 65 and older (2.3 million people) had received the shingles vaccine, while 51.1% (3.1 million) had received the pneumococcal vaccine. Being a woman, having higher socioeconomic status, having had the flu shot and having a regular health care provider were associated with increased odds of vaccination. Being an immigrant, living outside large population centres, and belonging to South Asian or Chinese population groups were associated with lower odds of vaccination. Over one-third of unvaccinated people did not think the shingles vaccine (39.7%) or the pneumococcal vaccine (36.6%) was necessary. Other frequently reported reasons for non-vaccination were not having heard of the vaccine or the doctor not mentioning it; for the shingles vaccine, 12% cited cost as a reason. Interpretation:Understanding factors associated with uptake of vaccines and reasons for not obtaining them among older Canadians will help to inform policy and programs aimed at preventing the burden of these diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To investigate the circadian changes of the autonomic function in patients with zoster-associated pain (ZAP). Methods:A total of 37 patients with ZAP from April 2022 to October 2022 were enrolled as the observation group, and 37 normal volunteers at the same time were selected as the control group. All participants were required to wear a 24-h Holter, which was used to compare the heart rate variability (HRV) between the two groups. HRV analysis involved time- and frequency-domain parameters. Results:There was no statistically significant difference in general information between two groups. Patients with ZAP had an increased mean heart rate and decreased the standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN) R-R interval, the root mean square of the differences (RMSSD) in successive RR interval, low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF) compared with control groups in all periods (p < .05). The ratio of LF/HF between two groups had no significant difference (p = .245). SDNN had no significant difference between day and night in the control group (p > .05), whereas SDNN of ZAP patients in night period was reduced than that in day period (p < .001). The level of RMSSD during the day was lower than those at night in the control group (p < .05), whereas no significant difference of RMSSD between two periods was observed in patients with ZAP (p > .05). Conclusion:The results of this study indicated that ZAP contributes to the decline of autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, especially parasympathetic components. The patients with ZAP lost parasympathetic advantage and had a worse ANS during the night.",

Methods:We inserted the gB protein extracellular region gene (gB-ex, 1-2208 bp) of VZV into lentivirus vector, and then obtained the recombinant gB protein through mammalian expression system. BALB/c mice were immunized multiple times with purified gB protein as immunogen. Then four strains of high affinity monoclonal antibodies targeting gB protein were prepared by cell fusion technique. Monoclonal antibodies 5G4 and HRP-4E9 were selected as capture and detection antibodies respectively, and a double-antibody sandwich ELISA method was established for detection. Results:The detection limit of the DAS-ELISA was 156 PFU/mL, and there was no cross-reaction with Herpes simplex virus-1/Herpes simplex virus-2/Pseudorabies virus. The coefficients of variation of intra-assay and inter-assay repeatability were less than 5%. Conclusions:In this study, a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) was established for the detection of VZV. The assay has good sensitivity, specificity and repeatability, which provides strong technical support and product guarantee for the rapid clinical detection of VZV.",

        "title": "Efficacy and Safety of Pulsed Radiofrequency of Dorsal Root Ganglion in Elderly Patient Population With Acute and Subacute Zoster-Related Pain",
        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (HZ) is typically characterized by a burning, stabbing pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. In some patients, despite the lesions resolving, the pain persists and becomes chronic. If the pain continues for more than 6 months after the onset of the pain phase, this condition is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The frequency and severity of PHN increase with advancing age. The pain in PHN can be severe, sometimes resistant to medications, significantly impacting the patients' quality of life. The elderly patient population cannot tolerate the medications due to their side effects. In this situation, interventional pain treatment should be applied in the elderly patient group who have a high risk of developing PHN compared to other age groups.Method:We included patients over 65 years of age with HZ-related pain who underwent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) within the first 6 months from the onset of pain. We divided these patients into 2 groups: patients who underwent intervention within the first 1 month from the onset of pain and patients who underwent intervention between 1 and 6 months. We recorded medication doses and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores before the procedure and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the procedure.Results:After the DRG PRF treatment, NRS scores improved significantly in both groups (p< 0.05). The mean NRS score in the early DRG PRF group was significantly lower than that in the late DRG PRF group (p< 0.05). The medication doses in the early DRG PRF group were significantly lower than those in the other group (p< 0.05).Conclusions: Interventional pain treatment should be applied as soon as possible in the elderly patient group who do not respond to first-line medical treatment or cannot tolerate medical treatment due to its side effects and who have a high risk of developing PHN compared to other age groups. DRG PRF, applied in the early period of medical treatment-resistant acute HZ, is safe and effective, preventing the progression to PHN.",

        "abstract": "Hemorrhoids are normal anatomical structures in the anus. When symptomatic, they prompt medical attention due to pain, rectal bleeding, and discomfort. Treatment includes dietary modifications, rubber band ligations, sclerotherapy, cryotherapy, or hemorrhoidectomy. Histologic examination is important to rule out incidental findings, such as perianal intraepithelial neoplasia, anal carcinoma, melanoma, or coexisting infections. Special attention should be given when patient is immunocompromised. We present a case of a 41-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis on adalimumab who presented with anal lesions. He was diagnosed with hemorrhoids and surgically treated. Microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of hemorrhoids. However, foci of epithelium with viral cytopathic effects were noted. A varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunostain was positive in the areas of interest confirming the diagnosis of the VZV infection limited to the hemorrhoids. Combined herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (HSV 1 and HSV 2) immunostain was also performed and was negative. Anal herpes has been widely described in the literature, particularly in immunocompromised patients. However, isolated VZV infection in hemorrhoids to the best of our knowledge has never been reported.",

        "abstract": "Background:Trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (TPHN) is a severe chronic pain that can lead to various socioeconomic consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to explore optimal treatment options for acute/subacute herpes zoster (HZ)-related trigeminal neuralgia and prevent the further development of TPHN. High-voltage, long-duration pulsed radiofrequency (HL-PRF) of the Gasserian ganglion is a new surgical intervention used to treat PHN. A ganglion block has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory effects and potential analgesic benefits.Methods:We included 83 patients with HZ-related acute/subacute trigeminal neuralgia admitted from January 1, 2021, to June 1, 2023, and received Gasserian ganglion HL-PRF combined with block. A 6-month follow-up was conducted, including Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the incidence of TPHN, the dosage of anticonvulsants and analgesics, efficacy, and adverse events.Results:All patients showed a significant decrease in postoperative NRS scores (p< 0.05). The NRS scores of the acute HZ group were consistently lower than those of the subacute HZ group at different time points (p< 0.01). The overall incidence of TPHN from the onset of HZ to 12 weeks is 21.68%. The incidence of TPHN in the acute phase group was 12.77%, significantly lower than the 33.33% in the subacute phase group (p=0.024). The effective rate was 74.7% in all patients, at 3 months after the treatment. The effective rate was 82.98% in the acute phase group and 63.89% in the subacute phase group, showing a statistically significant difference (p=0.047). The PSQI score of the acute group was consistently lower than that of the subacute group (p< 0.01). The dosage of analgesics and anticonvulsants used in the acute HZ group was lower than that in the subacute group (p< 0.01). All patients did not experience serious adverse reactions.Conclusions:Gasserian ganglion HL-PRF combined with block can be an effective and safe technique to relieve the pain of acute/subacute zoster-related trigeminal neuralgia and prevent the incidence of TPHN.",

Second, to compare MRZR with the determination of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB), oligoclonal kappa free light chain bands (oKFLC), and the KFLC index. Methods:A single-center retrospective study was conducted at the University Hospital Ostrava (Czech Republic). Patients were eligible if aged ≥18 years with a determined clinical diagnosis. IgG antibodies against measles (M), rubella (R), and varicella zoster (Z) viruses were determined in paired CSF and serum using ELISA and MRZR indicated as positive if at least two components had an antibody index >1.4. OCB and oKFLC were detected by means of isoelectric focusing, and KFLC CSF and serum concentrations for calculation of the KFLC index were determined immunochemically. Results:A total of 1,751 patients were included in the analyzed data set, which comprised 379 MS patients and 1,372 non-MS controls. The frequency of positive MRZR was higher in MS than in non-MS cases (MS 32.2 % vs non-MS 2.8 %; p < 0.001). This corresponded to a specificity of 97.2 % (95 % CI 96.1-98.0) and sensitivity of 32.2 % (95 % CI 27.5-37.2) and overall accuracy of 83.1 % (95 % CI 81.3-84.8). In comparison, the highest sensitivity of 95.6% (95 % CI 93.0-97.5) was for OCB with specificity of 86.9 % (95 % CI 84.9-88.7), followed by oKFLC with sensitivity and specificity of 94.7 % (95 % CI 91.5-96.9) and 78.4% (95 % CI 75.7-80.8), respectively, and the KFLC index with sensitivity of 92.5 % (95 % CI 86.6-96.3) and specificity of 93.5 % (95 % CI 90.5-95.9). Discussion:MRZR remains a very specific test for the diagnosis of MS but has low sensitivity, which disallows its independent use. In contrast, OCB showed the highest sensitivity and thus remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of MS.",

Self-managing immunization status can be challenging and potentially lead to missed vaccinations. This study aimed to describe the statuses and patterns of indicated vaccine uptake among older adults. This descriptive study utilized data from a large-scale nationwide internet survey in Japan (n = 6,828). Participants aged 65 years and older were asked about their immunization status for four vaccines in Japan: coronavirus disease 2019, influenza, pneumococcal, and herpes zoster vaccines. Overall, 6.8 % of the participants received all four vaccines, whereas 9.5 % had not received any of four vaccines. Many participants received one to three types of vaccinations (one type: 24.7 %, two types: 30.8 %, three types: 28.1 %). Attention should be focused on vaccine uptake among older adults.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:This study aimed to identify the specific vaccine strain associated with herpes zoster (HZ) in children following a series of diagnosed cases and to explore whether differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among various vaccine strains are linked to an increased incidence of herpes zoster after vaccination. Methods:From February 2021 to March 2024, children <12 years old suspected of vaccine-related varicella-like rash or HZ were included. Varicella zoster virus DNA isolated from the patients were sequenced to differentiate vaccine type versus wild-type. 3D protein structures of pORF62 were simulated using open reading frame 62 sequences extracted from whole genome sequencing of vOka, MAV/06, Oka/SK vaccines, and pOka reference. Results:A total of 27 children with a median age of 2.1 (interquartile range, 1.5-3.4) years old presented with vaccine-related varicella-like rash (n = 4/27, 14.8%) or HZ (n = 23/27, 85.2%). One patient with varicella-like rash and 34.8% (n = 8/23) with HZ had disseminated skin involvement. All were immunized with the Oka/SK strain varicella vaccine. Genotyping showed 88.2% (n = 15/17) had SNPs specific to the Oka/SK strain, and two had SNPs considered pOka type contained within the Oka/SK vaccine. Despite accumulations of SNPs in ORF 62 of Oka/SK, the translated amino acid sequence and 3D protein structure were identical to wild-type pOka's pORF62. In vOKA and MAV/06, changes in amino acids occurred at two positions, S628G and R958G, within pORF62. The predicted 3D protein structure of vOka and MAV/06's pORF62 showed that the α helical structure within region I undergoes conformational change, potentially increasing difficulties in interactions with infection-related proteins and thereby decreasing virulence. pORF62 in pOka and Oka/SK exhibited more stable structure complex of the α helical structure. Discussion:Lack of structural alternations in region I of pORF62 due to the absence of critical genetic polymorphisms in open reading frame 62 could be associated with the heightened incidence of adverse events.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:During the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of childhood infectious diseases was increased. Post-COVID-19 escalation of chickenpox cases, becoming an emerging public health concern. Thus, the study was designed to compare chickenpox prevalence and Varicella zoster virus (VZV) genotypes circulating before, during, and post-COVID-19 in Pakistan. Methods:A total of 267 lesion specimens collected from tertiary care hospitals, and chickenpox outbreaks from Pakistan were analysed by a two-amplicon approach with phylogenetic analysis. Results:Among suspected cases, overall 178/267 were VZV positive. Majority (84.2 %; 150/178) cases were of post-COVID-19 pandemic time. Small outbreaks occurred soon after COVID-19 in Rawalpindi and Islamabad (Pakistan), 40 positive cases out of 178 cases were outbreak cases. There was first time detection of the M4 genotype, which was significantly associated with disease severity (p = 0.0006) and post-COVID-19 chickenpox outbreaks in 2021 (77.9 %; 46/59; p < 0.00001). However, in pre-COVID-19 only M2 genotype was detected. The M2 prevalence varied from 2019 (100 %; 19/19) to 2022 (3.2 %; 3/91). However, the most prevalent strain of 2022 belonged to the M1 genotype (64.8 %; 59/91). Conclusion:A significant rise in chickenpox cases detected soon after COVID-19 in Pakistan, and oscillation of different VZV genotypes with first time detection of M4 genotype is an alarming situation. This demands further detailed genotypic studies on transmission dynamics of a rare M4 with other genotypes to protect the local population and restrict spread in other regions.",

        "abstract": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease caused by enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6)-associated HFMD has recently emerged as a predominant disease worldwide. Here, we describe five HFMD cases caused by CV-A6 in Japan from 2019 to 2022. All clinical courses were not severe and were self-limited, and the skin exanthema with vesicles differed from that in classical HFMD. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the major epidemic strain cluster of CV-A6 was formed independently in 2011, and our latest CV-A6 strains in Japan were detected within this cluster. The five cases described in this report indicate the recent shift in the predominant and continuous disease manifestation of CV-A6-associated HFMD.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:This study aimed to compare the efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) to dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in treating acute herpetic neuralgia (AHN) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in the thoracic segment. Methods:A total of 243 patients with thoracic herpes zoster-related pain (AHN or PHN) from January 2020 to September 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into two groups based on the timing of PRF after herpes zoster onset: an acute herpetic neuralgia group (within 90 days) and a postherpetic neuralgia group (more than 90 days). All patients were treated with PRF at the thoracic DRG. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9) scores were assessed before and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery, and the results were then compared between the two groups. Results:Postoperative scores of VAS, AIS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 in both groups were significantly lower than preoperative scores (P< 0.001). From 1 month to 12 months after surgery, the AHN group showed significantly lower VAS, AIS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 scores compared to the PHN group (P< 0.001). In the AHN group, there was a gradual improvement in these scores from 1 week to 12 months post-surgery. Conversely, the PHN group's scores began to worsen slowly from 1 week to 12 months post-surgery. Over time, the difference in scores between the two groups also increased gradually. Conclusion:PRF to the DRG is an effective treatment for patients with AHN or PHN who do not respond well to conventional treatments. For AHN patients, PRF to the DRG significantly enhances early pain control, improves sleep and psychological status, and may even prevent the development of PHN.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess whether recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is associated with an increased risk of new-onset gout among US adults aged ≥50 years. Methods:We conducted a real-world, retrospective safety study with a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) design using administrative claims data. We included health plan members aged ≥50 years with RZV exposure, followed by incident gout within 60 days. Days 1-30 following RZV exposure were considered the risk window (RW), and days 31-60 were considered the control window (CW). We estimated the risk ratio (RR) of gout in the RW versus CW, using a conditional Poisson model. The primary analysis estimated the risk of incident gout following any RZV dose. Sensitivity analyses evaluated dose 1- and dose 2-specific risks, risk among patients compliant with recommended dose spacing of 60-183 days, adjustment for seasonality, and restriction to the pre-COVID-19 era (before December 1, 2019). Results:A total of 461,323 individuals received ≥1 RZV dose; we included 302 individuals (mean age 72.5 years; 66 % male) with evidence of new-onset gout within 60 days in SCRI analyses. A total of 153 (50.7 %) individuals had gout events in the RW and 149 (49.3 %) in the CW (RR 1.03; 95 % confidence interval 0.81, 1.29). All sensitivity analyses had consistent results, with no association of RZV with incident gout. Conclusion:In a population of US adults aged ≥50 years, there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of gout during the 30 days immediately after RZV exposure, compared with a subsequent 30-day CW.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Assess the risk of incident gout following exposure to recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV). Methods:This case-only, self-controlled risk interval study included a cohort of US fee-for-service Medicare (Part A, B, and D) beneficiaries aged ≥65 years. The exposure was receipt of at least one dose of the two-dose RZV regimen in 2018 or 2019. The risk and control windows were days 1-30 and days 31-60, respectively, following vaccination. Incident gout was defined as the first episode of gout during the risk or control window, with no evidence of gout in the last 365 days. We estimated the relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) of incident gout in the risk window relative to the control window, using conditional Poisson regression models. Sensitivity analyses included a dose-compliant subanalysis of individuals who received dose 2 60-183 days after dose 1; dose-specific analysis; seasonality adjustment; and COVID-19 adjustment for potential detection bias due to the pandemic. Results:The 1290 RZV-exposed individuals with incident gout were primarily White (86.98 %), male (61.16 %), and aged 70-79 years (55.82 %). The RR of incident gout was 1.00 (95 % CI 0.90, 1.12). In the dose-compliant sensitivity analysis (n = 959 cases of incident gout), the RR of incident gout was 0.99 (95 % CI 0.87, 1.13). The findings were unchanged in the dose-specific, seasonality, and COVID-19 sensitivity analyses. Conclusion:The findings suggest that RZV is not significantly associated with an increased risk of incident gout in the Medicare population aged ≥65 years.",

        "abstract": "Background:Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) is a rare disease considered caused by acute demyelination of the brainstem, most often resulting from secondary autoimmune responses. To our knowledge, this is the first probable case report of shingles-associated BBE with anti-sulfatide IgM positivity. Case presentation:We report the case of an 83-year-old woman with symptoms of progressive limb weakness, difficulty swallowing food, and disturbed consciousness that occurred 4 weeks following herpes zoster infection. Autoimmune anti-sulfatide antibodies were positive and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences revealed clear high signal intensity in pons and bilateral thalamus. Our patient's condition improved markedly with glucocorticoid treatment. After 2 months of treatment, our patient was fully recovered. We considered that for her case, BBE is the most appropriate diagnosis. Conclusions:We emphasize the importance of a careful medical history and assessment of clinical symptoms, performing MRI, testing autoimmune antibodies for rapid diagnosis, and ruling out differential diagnoses. Further studies involving more patients with BBE with IgM anti-sulfatide autoantibodies will increase the understanding of the clinical characteristics and advance the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. Meanwhile, it is crucial for dermatologists to know about this severe neurological complication following shingles.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, multivariate data analysis (MVDA) has been widely used for process characterization and fault diagnosis in the biopharmaceutical industry. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using MVDA for the development and scale-up of a perfusion process for HEK293 cell-based recombinant adenovirus zoster vaccine (Ad-HER) production. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results suggested comparable performance among the ATF, PATFP, and BFP perfusion systems in benchtop-scale stirred-tank bioreactor (STR). Then a Batch Evolution Model (BEM) was built using representative data from 10 L STR with a BFP system to assess the Ad-HER perfusion process performance at pilot-scale bioreactor (50 L STR and 50 L wave bioreactor). Furthermore, another BEM model and Batch Level Model (BLM) were built to monitor process parameters over time and predict the final adenovirus titer in 50 L wave bioreactor. The loading plot revealed that lactate dehydrogenase activity, viable cell diameter, and base-added during the virus production phase could be used as preliminary indicators of adenovirus yield. Finally, an adenovirus titer of 2.0±0.3×1010IFU/mL was achieved in the 50 L wave bioreactor with BFP system, highlighting the robustness of the Ad-HER perfusion process at pilot-scale. Overall, this study emphasizes the effectiveness of MVDA as a tool for advancing the understanding of recombinant adenovirus vaccine perfusion production process development and scale-up.",

        "abstract": "Background:Cerebral infarct associated with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) has been reported in the literature, while isolated central dizziness due to lateral medullary infarct (LMI) following VZV infection is rarely reported. Case report:We report the case of a 65-year-old man who presented to the neurology department because of herpes zoster on the right trigeminal nerve distribution. At 12 hours after admission, he developed transient vertigo along with nausea and unsteady walking and left-sided spontaneous horizontal nystagmus, gaze-evoked nystagmus, and upbeat nystagmus. The other usual signs of LMI including Horner syndrome, dysarthria, swallowing difficulty, and hemibody sensory change were absent. Video head impulse indicated decreased head impulse gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex for the bilateral horizontal, anterior, and posterior semicircular canals with abnormal saccade waves. Suppression head impulse paradigm showed few downward saccades reflecting anti-compensatory saccades after the end of the head impulse back to the head-fixed target and decreased vestibulo-ocular reflex gain values of bilateral semicircular canals. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a small infarct in the far dorsolateral portion of the left rostral medulla. The cerebrospinal fluid was positive for VZV DNA. Conclusions:In patients with VZV infection who develop dizziness, the possibility of cerebral infarct should be considered. Patients with facial herpes zoster and neurological symptoms always be screened for stroke using MRI and lumbar puncture should be performed and acyclovir administered empirically.",

The high efficacy of RZV is attributed to its highly reactogenic adjuvant, AS01, but limited studies have been done on AS01's activation of human immune cells. Methods:We stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with AS01 and used flow cytometry and RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze the impacts on human primary cells. Results:We found that incubation of PBMC with AS01 activated monocytes to a greater extent than any other cell population, including dendritic cells. Both classical and non-classical monocytes demonstrated this activation. RNASeq showed that TNF-ɑ and IL1R pathways were highly upregulated in response to AS01 exposure, even in older adults. Conclusions:In a PBMC co-culture, AS01 strongly activates human monocytes to upregulate costimulation markers and induce cytokines that mediate systemic inflammation. Understanding AS01's impacts on human cells opens possibilities to further address the reduced vaccine response associated with aging.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Solid organ transplant recipients are at high risk for developing severe zoster-associated neuralgia, and the pharmaceutic therapies of pain management for these patients with limited organ function are challenging. Intravenous lidocaine infusion showed positive analgesic effects and is used for the management of neuropathic pain. This case series reports the safety and effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine infusion in the treatment of intractable zoster-associated neuralgia in solid organ transplant recipients. Case series presentation:Five solid organ transplant recipients suffering from refractory zoster-associated neuralgia (numeric rating scale 8-10, despite using high doses of antiepileptic drugs or combined with opioids) were enrolled. Intravenous lidocaine (5 mg/kg ideal bodyweight) was administered over 1.5 h with the monitoring of vital signs. Pain intensity, patient satisfaction, adverse events, typical liver, and kidney function were evaluated. All subjects reported high satisfaction with their treatment and effective pain relief at the 6-month follow-up. One patient experienced short and mild numbness in the mouth and dizziness after the therapy, but no major adverse reactions were reported. Conclusion:This case series provides evidence that intravenous lidocaine infusion provided effective pain relief as an analgesic treatment option for transplant patients with intractable zoster-associated neuralgia.",

Case reports:Case 1: A 48-year-old female presented at our clinic with blurred vision in the right eye for 7 days. She was diagnosed with ARN in the left eye 2 weeks ago. Ophthalmic examination revealed reduced visual acuity in the right eye (20/33) with the presence of optic disc swelling and macular exudation without peripheral necrotic lesions. With systemic antiviral therapy, optic disc swelling of the right eye vanished gradually, and the visual acuity improved to 20/20. Loss of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and decreased retinal thickness in the corresponding area occurred during follow-up. Conclusion:Non-necrotizing herpetic uveitis may occur in the contralateral eye of unilateral ARN under rare conditions. Structure abnormities, including loss of RNFL and focal decreased retinal thickness, are irretrievable.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Heterologous immunization using different vaccine platforms has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy to enhance antigen-specific immune responses. In this study, we performed a head-to-head comparison of both humoral and cellular immune response induced by different prime-boost immunization regimens of mRNA vaccine and adjuvanted protein subunit vaccine against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in middle-aged mice, aiming to get a better understanding of the influence of vaccination schedule on immune response. Methods:VZV glycoprotein (gE) mRNA was synthesized and encapsulated into SM-102-based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). VZV-primed middle-aged C57BL/6 mice were then subjected to homologous and heterologous prime-boost immunization strategies using VZV gE mRNA vaccine (RNA-gE) and protein subunit vaccine (PS-gE). The antigen-specific antibodies were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Additionally, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was detected using ELISPOT assay and flow cytometry. Besides, in vivo safety profiles were also evaluated and compared. Results:The mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles had a hydrodynamic diameter of approximately 130 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.156. Total IgG antibody levels exhibited no significant differences among different immunization strategies. However, mice received 2×RNA-gE or RNA-gE>PS-gE showed a lower IgG1/IgG2c ratio than those received 2×PS-gE and PS-gE> RNA-gE. The CMI response induced by 2×RNA-gE or RNA-gE>PS-gE was significantly stronger than that induced by 2×PS-gE and PS-gE> RNA-gE. The safety evaluation indicated that both mRNA vaccine and protein vaccine induced a transient body weight loss in mice. Furthermore, the protein vaccine produced a notable inflammatory response at the injection sites, while the mRNA vaccine showed no observable inflammation. Conclusion:The heterologous prime-boost strategy has demonstrated that an mRNA-primed immunization regimen can induce a better cell-mediated immune response than a protein subunit-primed regimen in middle-aged mice. These findings provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of VZV vaccines with the potentials to broaden varicella vaccination strategies in the future.",

Our study assessed the risk of ED in COVID-19 patients as compared to patients with other common viral infections. The TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network was queried. We examined cohorts of men aged ≥18 years infected with: COVID-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, acute viral hepatitis, mononucleosis, and herpes zoster. Men were included if they had at least one outpatient follow-up visit within 18 months and excluded if they had one of the other viruses of interest or a prior ED diagnosis or treatment, prostatectomy, pelvis radiation, or chronic hepatitis infection. Cohorts were propensity score matched and compared for differences in new ED diagnosis and/or prescription of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i). COVID-19 positive men were less likely to develop ED or have a PDE5i prescription than men with infected with herpes zoster [Relative Risk (RR): 0.37, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.27-0.49] and more likely to develop ED or have a PDE5i prescription than men with no acute viral illness (RR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.25-1.42). In this national propensity-matched cohort study comparing post-infection ED risk and PDE5i prescriptions, we found that COVID-19 was no more likely to result in a diagnosis of ED or prescription of PDE5i when compared to all acute viral illnesses except herpes zoster, which was more likely to result in a diagnosis of ED or prescription of PDE5i when compared to COVID-19. These findings suggest an inflammatory etiology (perhaps due to cytokine release, endothelial dysfunction, or blunted hormone signaling) behind any acute infection can result in a heightened ED risk; however, further studies are required to investigate the connection between other viral infections and ED.",

        "abstract": "Background:Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is among the leading pathogens causing meningitis and encephalitis. While VZV-PCR-positive CSF is considered a gold-standard for diagnosis, it is not-uncommon to detect VZV-DNA in CSF of patients with other acute or chronic illness. Our goal was to determine the clinical relevance of VZV-PCR-positive CSF when investigating patients with neurological symptoms. Methods:In this retrospective cohort from the largest hospital in Israel, we collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data of patients with VZV-PCR-positive CSF, analyzing the significance of various parameters. Results:During a 5-years study, 125 patient-unique VZV-PCR-positive CSFs were recorded, in which only 9 alternative diagnoses were noted. The commonest symptoms were headache (N = 104, 83 %) and rash (N = 96, 76 %). PCR-cycle-threshold (Ct), a surrogate of viral burden, did not significantly vary across the clinical manifestations; however, patients with rash and Ct<35 were prone to develop stroke in the following year (N = 6, 7 %). Empiric nucleoside-analogue treatment was not associated with a better outcome compared to treatment administered upon a positive-PCR result. Discussion:Our findings suggest that in patients with neurological symptoms, detection of VZV-DNA in CSF renders VZV the probable culprit. Nevertheless, a systematic evaluation of treatment and follow-up algorithms of patients with suspected or proved VZV meningitis and encephalitis is needed. The benefits of a prompt treatment should be weighed against the potential complications of nucleoside-analogue. Conversely, the propensity for stroke in patients with higher viral-burden, necessitates further studies assessing VZV causal role, directing additional workup, treatment and monitoring policy.",

        "abstract": "Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition that causes patchy skin depigmentation. Although the mechanism by which vitiligo induces immunocompromise is unclear, other related autoimmune diseases are known to predispose those affected to infection. Individuals with vitiligo exhibit epidermal barrier disruption, which could potentially increase their susceptibility to systemic infections; patients with renal disease also show a predisposition to infection. Nevertheless, there is little research addressing the risk of infection in dialysis patients with vitiligo in comparison to those without it. A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States Renal Data System who started dialysis between 2004 and 2019 to determine if ESRD patients with vitiligo are at an increased risk of bacteremia, cellulitis, conjunctivitis, herpes zoster, or septicemia. Multivariable logistic regression modeling indicated that female sex, black compared to white race, Hispanic ethnicity, hepatitis C infection, and tobacco use were associated with an enhanced risk of vitiligo, whereas increasing age and catheter, versus arteriovenous fistula, and access type were associated with a decreased risk. After controlling for demographics and clinical covariates, vitiligo was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of bacteremia, cellulitis, and herpes zoster but not with conjunctivitis and septicemia.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Varicella, a highly contagious viral disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), affects millions globally, with a higher prevalence among children. After the initial infection, VZV lies dormant in sensory ganglia and has the potential to reactivate much later, causing herpes zoster (HZ). Vaccination is one of the most effective methods to prevent varicella, and the two-dose varicella vaccine (VarV) regimen is widely used around the world. In China, the VarV has been included in the national immunization programme with a recommended single-dose regimen. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two-dose vs. one-dose VarV regimen in children in Shanghai, China. Materials and methods:A prospective cohort study was conducted in Shanghai, China, from September 2018 to December 2022. The study enrolled children aged 3-18 years who had received either the one-dose, two-dose, or 0-dose VarV regimen. Vaccination history, varicella infection status, and relevant variables, including demographic information (name, date of birth and sex) and medical history (clinical features of varicella and illness duration) were collected through medical record review and parental interviews. Results:A total of 3,838 children were included in the study, with 407 in the 0-dose regimen group, 2,107 in the one-dose regimen group and 1,324 in the two-dose regimen group. The corresponding incidence density in these groups was 0.13, 0.05 and 0.03 cases per 1,000 person-days, respectively. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 81.7% (95%CI: 59.3-91.8%) for the two-dose regimen and 60.3% (95%CI: 29.3-77.7%) for the one-dose regimen, compared to the 0-dose regimen. The two-dose VarV regimen showed a protective effectiveness of 47.6% (95%CI: 2.5-71.9%) compared to the one-dose VarV regimen. Conclusion:This study provides evidence supporting the greater effectiveness of the two-dose VarV regimen in preventing varicella infection compared to the one-dose regimen.",

Among them, single-time high-voltage long-term pulsed radiofrequency (HL-PRF) has been proved to be an effective treatment for subacute postherpetic neuralgia. However, it has the possibility of poor long-term curative effect and recurrence of neuralgia.

Patients:We enrolled all patients with subacute postherpetic neuralgia, who underwent HL-PRF treatment from January 2023 to October 2023. Measurements:The primary outcome variable was the visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. Secondary outcomes included Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) score, and total effective rate after treatment. Results:A total of 63 patients were included in the analysis. Among them, 33 patients received single-time HL-PRF treatment (Group S) and 30 patients received twice repeated HL-PRF treatment (Group T). Pain scores, PSQI scores, and SF-36 score were reduced in both groups after treatment (P< 0.001). Compared to group S, the VAS scores, PSQI scores, anxiety scores, and depression scores were significantly lower at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks in group T. (P< 0.001). The total efficiency rate at 12 weeks after treatment of group T was statistically higher than that of group S (60.6% vs 86.7%,P< 0.05). Conclusion:Twice repeated high-voltage long-duration PRF therapy demonstrates satisfactory efficacy in patients with subacute postherpetic neuralgia and is associated with no significant adverse reactions.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:The objective of this case series is to highlight different manifestations of valacyclovir associated neurotoxicity (VAN) and demonstrate the importance of adjusting medication appropriately in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis to prevent these complications.Summary:Valacyclovir is a medication used to treat herpes zoster infection, commonly known as shingles. Valacyclovir is renally cleared and can accumulate in patients with renal dysfunction leading to severe side effects due to the prolonged half-life. VAN is a common adverse effect in patients with underlying kidney disease, that can be easily prevented if valacyclovir is properly dosed. This case series details the clinical outcomes of two elderly patients who were prescribed valacyclovir at six-times the recommended dose based on their renal function. Failure to reduce the dose of valacyclovir resulted in severe neurological and physical manifestations that required hospital admission and emergent hemodialysis.Conclusion:This case series details the importance of adjusting valacyclovir dose based on renal function. In patients with ESRD, the half-life of valacyclovir can be up to 14 hours, therefore hemodialysis should be utilized in severe cases of neurotoxicity to improve rapid excretion of the drug and promote rapid recovery from VAN.",

        "abstract": "The concurrent development of abducens nerve palsy and optic neuritis on the same side is rare. Here we presented an 82-year-old man who developed the combination of abducens nerve palsy and optic neuritis on the left side 2 months after the sixth inoculation of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. In past history at 45 years old, he experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage and underwent surgery for the clipping of intracranial aneurysm. The patient had no systemic symptoms, such as general fatigue, fever, arthralgia, and skin rashes. Physical and neurological examinations were also unremarkable. Since the aneurysmal metal clip used at that time was not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging, he underwent computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head and showed no space-occupying lesion in the orbit, paranasal sinuses, and brain. As an old lesion, the anterior temporal lobe on the left side had low-density area with metallic artifact on the left side of the skull base, indicative of metal clipping. In 4 weeks of observation from the initial visit, he showed complete recovery of visual acuity and became capable of abducting the left eye in full degrees. We also reviewed 8 patients with the combination of abducens nerve palsy and optic neuritis in the literature to reveal that the combination of signs did occur in mild meningitis with rare infectious diseases and in association with preceding herpes zoster in the first branch of the trigeminal nerve. The course of the present patient suggested that the combination of signs might be vaccine-associated.",

Methods:A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Ichushi-Web, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Published randomized controlled trials and observational studies, which compared antivirals versus placebo/no treatment for Ramsay Hunt syndrome, were included in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was non-recovery at the end of the study follow-up. Data was analyzed using Review Manager Software, and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % CI were calculated. Results:Two randomized controlled trials and 7 cohort studies met the eligible criteria, and 474 individuals were included in the meta-analysis. The OR of antivirals for non-recovery was 0.68 (95 % CI 0.37-1.27, p = 0.22). In subgroup analysis, the OR were 0.48 (95 % CI 0.15-1.61, p = 0.24) in patients with antivirals monotherapy and 0.73 (95 % CI 0.34-1.57, p = 0.42) in patients treated with combination therapy of antivirals and systematic corticosteroid. Conclusion:This systematic review first shows the effectiveness of antivirals. Further study is needed to confirm the efficacy of antivirals.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Acute facial palsy, characterized by sudden hemifacial weakness, significantly impacts an individual's quality of life. Despite several predisposing factors identified for acute facial palsy, the specific relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and acute facial palsy has not been comprehensively explored in recent studies. The aim of the study was to assess the risk of acute facial palsy in patients with DM using a nationwide population sample cohort. Methods:DM cohort and non-DM cohort were built using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Sample Cohort which represents the entire population of the Republic of Korea from January 2002 to December 2019. The DM cohort comprised 92,872 patients with a record of medication and a diagnosis of DM. Individuals who had facial palsy before the diagnosis of DM were excluded. A comparison cohort comprised 1,012,021 individuals without DM matched sociodemographically in a 1:4 ratio. The incidence of Bell's palsy (BP) and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) were evaluated in both cohorts. The risk factors for acute facial palsy were also assessed. Results:Among the 92,868 patients in the DM cohort, the incidence rate (IR) of BP and RHS were 31.42 (confidence interval [CI], 30.24-32.63) and 4.58 per 10,000 person-years (CI, 4.14-5.05), respectively. Among the 371,392 individuals in the non-DM cohort, the IR of BP was 22.11 per 10,000 person-years (CI, 21.62-22.59) and the IR of RHS was 2.85 per 10,000 person-years (CI, 2.68-3.02). IR ratios for BP and RHS were 1.42 (CI, 1.36-1.48) and 1.61 (CI, 1.43-1.80). In multivariate analysis, DM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.428), age (HR 1.008), and high comorbidity score (HR 1.051) were associated with increased risk of BP, and male (HR 0.803) and living in metropolis (HR 0.966) decreased the risk of BP. And DM (HR 1.615), high comorbidity score (HR 1.078), and living in metropolis (HR 1.201) were associated with increased risk for RHS. Conclusion:This study suggests that patients with DM had an increased risk of acute facial palsy including BP and RHS.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Despite the increasing prevalence of IBD in non-white populations, little is known regarding racial disparities in VPD burden. Methods:Retrospectively analyzing the 2016 to 2020 National Inpatient Sample, we identified adults with IBD hospitalized for a principal diagnosis of VPD. The primary outcome investigated was hospitalization for VPD stratified by patient-reported race. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and health care utilization. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to adjust for patient and hospital characteristics. Results:The search identified 554,114 hospitalizations for VPD, including 4170 hospitalizations in patients with IBD. Patients with IBD had significantly greater odds of hospitalization from herpes zoster virus (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.73) and varicella zoster virus (aOR: 2.31). Comparing white and non-white patients with IBD, significant racial disparities were noted. Non-white patients were at greater odds of hospitalization from influenza (aOR: 1.74), herpes zoster virus (aOR: 1.77), and varicella zoster virus (aOR: 1.62). In-hospital morbidity was greater in non-white patients, including greater odds of requiring intensive care unit stay (aOR: 1.18). Morbidity was elevated in African Americans, with greater odds of acute kidney injury (aOR: 1.25), venous thromboembolism (aOR: 1.17), respiratory failure (aOR: 1.16), and intensive care unit stay (aOR: 1.18). No differences were found in mortality, length of stay, and health care utilization. Conclusions:Significant racial disparities in VPD hospitalization and in-hospital morbidity were found among adults with IBD in the United States. With the increasing prevalence of IBD in non-white populations, targeted efforts are needed to improve health equity.",

        "abstract": "Objective:This study uses retrospective longitudinal data from a large unselected cohort of patients with peripheral facial paralysis to determine the prevalence and patient characteristic predictors of sequelae receiving intervention. Study design:Retrospective case review. Setting:Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden serves as the only tertiary facial palsy center in the region. Here, patients are diagnosed, are followed up, and undergo all major interventions. Patients:All adult patients presenting with peripheral facial palsy due to idiopathic, zoster, or Borrelia origin at Karolinska, January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 with follow-up until December 2022. Interventions:Patient charts were studied to identify patient characteristics, etiology, initial treatment, severity of palsy, and treatments targeting sequelae. Main outcome measures:Types of initial and late treatments were noted. Sunnybrook and/or House-Brackmann scales were used for palsy grading. Results:Five hundred twenty-five patients were included. Thirty-three patients (6.3%) received botulinum toxin injections and/or surgical treatment. In this subgroup, 67% received corticosteroids compared to 85% of all patients ( p = 0.005), cardiovascular disease prevalence was higher (23 and 42%, respectively, p = 0.009). For 81 patients (15%), follow-up was discontinued although the last measurement was Sunnybrook less than 70 or House-Brackmann 3 to 6. Conclusions:Of patients with peripheral facial palsy, 6.3% underwent injections and/or surgical treatment within 12 years. However, due to a rather large proportion not presenting for follow-up, this might be an underestimation. Patients receiving late injections and/or surgical treatment had more comorbidities and received corticosteroid treatment to a significantly lower extent in the acute phase of disease.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is a kind of refractory disease, and treating it is important for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). But the evidence surrounding the current treatment options for these conditions is controversial, so exploring reasonable clinical treatment strategies for HZO is necessary. Neuromodulation is an excellent modality for the treatment of various neuropathic pain conditions. This trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of short-term supraorbital nerve stimulation (SNS) and the supraorbital nerve block (SNB) for HZO. Objectives:To determine whether short-term SNS relieves acute and subacute ophthalmic herpetic neuralgia. Study design:This prospective randomized controlled crossover trial compared short-term SNS to SNB. Setting:The operating room of a pain clinic. Methods:Patients with acute or subacute ophthalmic herpetic neuralgia were recruited. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either SNS or SNB. The primary outcome being measured was each patient's Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at 4 weeks. The secondary outcomes under measurement were the proportion of patients who achieved ≥ 50% pain relief, sleep quality, medicine consumption, and adverse events. Crossover after 4 weeks was permitted, and patients were followed up to 12 weeks. Results:Overall, 50 patients were included (n = 25/group). At 4 weeks, the patients who received SNS achieved greater pain relief, as indicated by their significantly different VAS scores from those of the SNB group (mean difference: -1.4 [95% CI, -2.29 to -0.51], P < 0.05). Both groups showed a significant decrease in pain level from the baseline (all P < 0.05). Overall, 72% and 44% of the SNS and SNB patients experienced ≥ 50% pain relief, respectively (OR: 0.31 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.99], P < 0.05), and 68% and 32% of SNS and SNB patients, respectively, had VAS scores < 3 (OR: 0.22 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.73], P < 0.05). Compared to the SNB group, the SNS group had better sleep quality, lower ophthalmic neuralgia, a lower proportion of further treatment, and lower analgesic intake. Overall, 18 patients received SNS alone, and 16 patients crossed over from SNB to SNS. The VAS scores, sleep quality, ophthalmic neuralgia, and trend of medicine intake were not significantly different between the groups (all P > 0.05). No serious complications occurred. Limitations:This study was nonblind. Conclusions:Short-term SNS is effective for controlling acute or subacute ophthalmic herpetic neuralgia. Combining SNS with SNB yields no additional benefits.",

Various causes, including spinal disorders and trauma, can lead to this condition; however, the most common cause is reported to be herpes zoster. We present a rare case of spontaneous resolution of abdominal pseudohernia following lung cancer surgery. A 71-year-old male presented with left upper abdominal bulging and pain. A CT scan performed at the time incidentally revealed a nodular lesion in the right lower lobe, suspicious for lung cancer. Single-port thoracoscopic surgery was performed, and the final diagnosis was right lower lobe lung squamous cell carcinoma. Following the lung cancer surgery, the left upper abdominal bulging spontaneously resolved within one week. In this case, we hypothesize that the immune dysregulation caused by lung cancer increased the activity of the herpes zoster virus, leading to the development of pseudohernia. The spontaneous resolution of the pseudohernia is thought to be due to the improvement of immune dysregulation after surgery.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:This retrospective study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of early combined therapy with CT-guided paravertebral nerve (PVN), pulsed radiofrequency (PRF), and subcutaneous block on acute/subacute herpes zoster (HZ). Methods:A total of 98 medical records were analyzed. All patients underwent CT-guided PRF on PVN immediately followed by a single subcutaneous block with lidocaine and dexamethasone in acute/subacute phase. The therapy efficacy was evaluated by pain numeric rating scale (NRS) and effective rate, which was defined as a percent of cases with a reduction in pain NRS>50% at day 1, week 2, 4, 12, and 24 after the procedure. The incidences of medication reduction and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) were also retrieved. Further comparison was conducted between acute group (disease duration<30 days from HZ onset) and subacute group (30 day<duration<90 days from HZ onset). Results:Early combined therapy indicated an immediate and sustained improvement in pain NRS as compared with before treatment ( P <0.0001), with effective rates of 74%, 79%, 80%, 76%, and 79% at day 1, week 2, 4, 12, and 24 after procedure, respectively. At the end of follow-up, the proportion of patients with a reduction of >50% in prior medications amounted to 83% and the incidence of clinically meaningful PHN decreased to 23%. The clinical efficacy was more profound in acute group than in subacute group at every time points ( P <0.05). No severe complications occurred. Discussion:Our data revealed surprising levels of pain relief by combination therapies of PRF and subcutaneous block targeting different sites of pain pathway, thus suggesting a valuable treatment option for acute/subacute herpetic neuralgia.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes zoster (shingles) is normally diagnosed clinically. Timely diagnosis is important so that antiviral treatment can be started soon after rash onset. Aim:To assess whether a practice-level educational intervention, aimed at non-clinical patient-facing staff, improves the timely assessment of patients with shingles. Design and setting:This was a cluster randomised study within a trial (SWAT) with nested qualitative study in general practices in England. Method:Practices were cluster randomised 1:1, stratified by centre and minimised by practice list size and Index of Multiple Deprivation score. Intervention practices were sent educational materials, highlighting the common presenting features of shingles and what action to take if suspected. The primary and secondary outcomes were the mean proportion of patients per practice seen within 72 and 144 h of rash onset, respectively. Comparison between groups was conducted using linear regression, adjusting for randomisation variables. Semi-structured interviews with practice staff in intervention practices explored views and opinions about the intervention. Results:In total, 67 practices were enrolled; 34 randomised to the intervention and 33 to the control. The mean difference in proportion of patients seen within 72 and 144 h was -0.132 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.308 to 0.043) and -0.039 (95% CI = -0.158 to 0.080), respectively. In intervention practices, 90.9% reported distributing the educational materials; however, engagement with these was suboptimal. Twelve participants were interviewed, and the poster component of the intervention was said to be easiest to implement. Conclusion:Our educational intervention did not improve the timely assessment of patients with shingles. This may be the result of poor intervention engagement.",

        "abstract": "Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a rare and rapidly progressive disease characterised by the development of panuveitis and peripheral retinal lesions. These lesions can often be missed during a routine fundoscopic examination, making the early diagnosis of ARN a considerable challenge. This case report describes the utilisation of ultrawidefield (UWF) imaging in the early detection of peripheral lesions associated with ARN in a male patient in his late 60s, who presented with acute blurred vision and a documented history of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. During a comprehensive eye examination and UWF imaging, panuveitis and peripheral lesions were identified, eventually leading to a diagnosis of ARN. The early initiation of antiviral therapy led to a gradual clinical improvement over 3-4 months. The utilisation of serial UWF imaging played a critical role in the prompt diagnosis and effective monitoring of disease progression, thereby potentially improving the patient's outcome.",

However, it is unclear if peripheral measures are accurate proxies for central nervous system (CNS) responses. Thus, we analyzed cytokine and Aβ42/Aβ40 changes in paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the course of infection. During varicella and zoster, every RM had variable changes in serum and CSF cytokine and Aβ42/Aβ40 levels compared to pre-inoculation levels. Overall, peripheral infection appears to affect CNS cytokine and Aβ42/Aβ40 levels independent of serum responses, suggesting that peripheral disease may contribute to CNS disease.",

Cases of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions caused by pregabalin generally occur within 2 weeks of initiating medication. We report a rare case of a delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction caused by pregabalin, which was confirmed by a drug provocation test. A 72-year-old man with severe herpes zoster neuralgia developed maculopapular drug eruption covering 80% to 90% of his total body surface area after 40 days of combined multidrug analgesia. A drug provocation test for pregabalin was positive. The time interval between initiating medication and the onset of the patient's rash was the longest and he also had the largest area of skin affected compared with patients with a similar condition in previous related reports. Remaining vigilant for possible adverse cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions during treatment is important because of the long-term course of pregabalin treatment for neuropathic pain.",

        "abstract": "Vaccinations are an important pillar of public health. They have high benefits for individuals and society as a whole by specifically preventing or mitigating infectious diseases. In many cases, they offer benefits that go beyond protection against the disease in question, e.g., protective cardiovascular effects. Vaccination recommendations in Germany are drawn up by the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO), while the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is responsible for the approval of vaccines in the EU. Vaccinations may be carried out by physicians regardless of their specialty. In dermatology, vaccinations against varicella (chickenpox), herpes zoster, and human papillomavirus are established. The development of vaccines against other dermatologically relevant diseases and cancer vaccines is the subject of intensive research. Particularly in the case of immunosuppression, the physician must also take into consideration which vaccinations are possible and useful or contraindicated. Type I or type IV allergies to components of vaccinations are very rare, but reactions at the injection site often occur as a dermatological side effect. Urticarial reactions are also possible, as does the worsening of underlying dermatological conditions such as psoriasis vulgaris. Impfungen gehören zu einer der wichtigsten Säulen der Prävention in der Medizin, da sie nicht nur einen individuellen Nutzen haben, sondern auch die Bevölkerung als Ganzes vor ansteckenden Krankheiten schützen. Sie bieten in vielen Fällen Vorteile, die über den alleinigen Schutz vor der jeweiligen Erkrankung hinausgehen, z. B. protektive kardiovaskuläre Effekte. Die Impfempfehlungen in Deutschland werden durch die Ständige Impfkommission (STIKO) erarbeitet, während die Europäische Arzneimittel-Agentur (EMA) für die Zulassung von Impfstoffen in der Europäischen Union (EU) zuständig ist. Durchgeführt werden dürfen Impfungen in Deutschland dann von Ärzten unabhängig von ihrer fachärztlichen Ausrichtung. Herausforderungen im klinischen Alltag sind neben sehr seltenen Typ-I- oder Typ-IV-Allergien gegen Bestandteile der Impfstoffe auch immunsuppressive Therapien, die bei der Impfplanung berücksichtigt werden müssen. In der Dermatologie sind die Impfungen gegen Varizellen (Windpocken), Herpes zoster und humane Papillomviren etabliert. Die Entwicklung von Impfstoffen gegen weitere dermatologisch relevante Erkrankungen sowie von Tumorvakzinierungen ist Gegenstand intensiver Forschung.",

        "abstract": "Background:Post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome which presents after an episode of herpes zoster caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus. Conservative treatment starts with pharmacological measures using Anti-epileptics and Antidepressants. Some patients also respond well to epidural steroid injections too, but the effect is usually short lasting. Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulator (DRG-S) has recently been suggested as a new treatment modality for PHN due to its selective targeting of the pathophysiologic focus. Case series:We are reporting three cases, who were suffering from neuropathic pain after an episode of herpes zoster. Pain and pain related suffering scores were high, even with multiple antiepileptics and opioid medications. They underwent DRG-S implant and appreciated more than 50% reduction of their pain score, meaningful reduction in the dose of medications along with significant improvement of their general well being measured using Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), pain disability index (PDI), and 9 Question Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). To our knowledge this is the first report on DRG stimulator from the Middle East Region. Conclusion:DRG-S has potential to be a preferable treatment option in patients with refractory PHN and acts as a specific targeted therapy in the treatment of these patients.",

        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome that is a direct consequence of the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV). It manifests as neuropathic pain, which is pain that occurs because of dysfunction or damage of the nerves that carry sensations to the brain, and this typically persists for months to years after herpes zoster. Current conservative management for PHN includes a combination of topical agents (i.e., lidocaine and capsaicin) and systemic therapy (i.e., serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, pregabalin, and opioids). For refractory cases, with persistent intractable pain, more invasive interventional techniques can be used as pain-relieving measures to improve the patient's quality of life. This report presents a patient with upper limb PHN who responded to peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) after he failed to obtain sufficient pain relief with conservative management.",

        "title": "[Electrical dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) for the treatment of refractory postherpetic neuralgia]",
        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a rare complication of herpes zoster characterized by prolonged and excruciating pain. Traditional treatments for PHN, such as analgesics, anticonvulsants and antidepressants, do not always bring the desired result. One promising alternative that is attracting the attention of the scientific community is dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS). This method focuses on targeted and precise targeting of the source of pain, providing a new level of effectiveness in the treatment of PHN. Objective:A retrospective analysis of the technique and results of implantation of a permanent device for stimulating the spinal ganglia in patients with refractory PHN at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Center. Material and methods:The study was conducted in 7 patients (5 men, 2 women) with refractory PHN in the period from 2018 to 2020. The age of the patients ranged from 57 to 84 years (average age 74±8.4). All patients were implanted with Boston systems (Precision or Spectra versions). Stimulation parameters: pulse width - 120-210 μs, frequency - 30-130 Hz, amplitude at the lower limit of the appearance of paresthesia with the possibility of increasing with increased pain up to 5 mA. The position of the electrode depended on the location of the pain. All systems were implanted under X-ray guidance. Results:The duration of follow-up observation was more than 2.5 years. The average pain intensity one year after treatment was 3.42±2.45 points on the visual analogue scale (VAS) (a 62.3% decrease in intensity compared to baseline). In 3 (42.8%) patients, the result was characterized by us as «excellent» (intensity according to VAS decreased by 75% or more), in 1 (14.2%) - as «good» (intensity according to VAS decreased by 50-74%), in 1 (14.2%) - as «moderate» (VAS intensity decreased by 25-49% and in 2 (28.5%) as «unsatisfactory» (VAS intensity decreased by less than 25%, or postoperative complications occurred). Conclusion:Given the complicated nature of PHN, the use of dorsal ganglion stimulation appears to be a promising and innovative treatment approach. Further research is needed to introduce this technique into clinical practice for the treatment of patients suffering from PHN. Постгерпетическая невралгия (ПГН) представляет собой редкое осложнение опоясывающего лишая, характеризующееся длительными и мучительными болевыми ощущениями. Традиционные методы лечения ПГН, такие как анальгетики, антиконвульсанты и антидепрессанты, не всегда приносят желаемый результат. Одним из перспективных альтернативных направлений, которое привлекает внимание научного сообщества, является стимуляция заднего ганглия спинного мозга (dorsal root ganglion stimulation, DRGS). Этот метод фокусируется на целенаправленном и точном воздействии на источник боли, обеспечивая новый уровень эффективности в лечении ПГН. Цель исследования:Ретроспективный анализ методики и результатов имплантации постоянного устройства для стимуляции спинномозговых ганглиев у пациентов с рефрактерной ПГН в ФГАУ «Национальный медицинский исследовательский центр нейрохирургии им. акад. Н.Н. Бурденко» Минздрава России. Материал и методы:Исследование проведено у 7 пациентов (5 мужчин, 2 женщины) с рефрактерной ПГН в период с 2018 по 2020 г. Возраст больных составил от 57 до 84 лет (средний — 74±8,4 года). Всем пациентам были имплантированы системы фирмы «Boston» (версий Precision или Spectra). Параметры стимуляции: ширина импульса 120—210 мкс, частота — 30—130 Гц, амплитуда на нижней границе появления парестезий с возможностью увеличения при усилении болей до 5 мА. Положение электрода зависело от локализации боли. Все системы были имплантированы под рентгенологическим контролем. Результаты:Длительность катамнестического наблюдения составила более 2,5 года. Средняя интенсивность боли через 1 год после лечения составила 3,42±2,45 балла по визуально-аналоговой шкале (ВАШ) (снижение интенсивности по сравнению с исходным уровнем на 62,3%). У 3 (42,8%) пациентов результат характеризовался нами как «отличный» (интенсивность по ВАШ снизилась на 75% и более), у 1 (14,2%) — как «хороший» (интенсивность по ВАШ снизилась на 50—74%), у 1 (14,2%) — как «умеренный» (интенсивность по ВАШ снизилась на 25—49%) и у 2 (28,5%) — как «неудовлетворительный» (интенсивность по ВАШ снизилась менее чем на 25% или возникли послеоперационные осложнения). Заключение:С учетом осложненной природы ПГН использование стимуляции заднего ганглия представляется перспективным и инновационным подходом к лечению. Необходимы дальнейшие исследования с целью внедрения данной методики в клиническую практику для лечения пациентов, страдающих ПГН.",

        "abstract": "In order to understand the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of vaccination against influenza, pneumonia, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes zoster (HZ), COVID-19, and hepatitis B among staff of vaccination units in Shandong Province, a sample survey was conducted among 797 staffs of adult vaccination units in 12 counties (cities and districts) of Shandong Province from August to September 2022. The results showed that the respondents had the highest total score of knowledge and attitude for the COVID-19 vaccine, with theM(Q1,Q3) of 23 (20, 25) and 10 (10, 10), respectively, and had the lowest score of knowledge and attitude for the herpes zoster vaccine, with theM(Q1,Q3) of 19 (15, 22) and 8 (8, 10), respectively. The vaccine-related knowledge point\"vaccine applicable population\"had the highest score, with theM (Q1,Q3)of 26 (23, 30). The \"contraindications/adverse reactions\" and \"adverse reaction management\" had the lowest score, with theM (Q1,Q3)of 24 (20, 29) and 24 (20, 28), respectively. About 89.71% of respondents received one adult vaccine within two years at least. The principal driver for vaccination of 53.58% of recipients was their understanding of vaccines, which was\"it was necessary to receive the vaccine\". About 66.00% of respondents who had not received any adult vaccine in the past two years had insufficient awareness of the necessity of vaccination and believed that they were in good health and did not need to receive it. In summary, the staff of adult vaccination units in Shandong Province have a poor understanding of the herpes zoster vaccine in terms of vaccines and a relatively poor understanding of\"contraindications/adverse reaction and management\"in adult vaccination knowledge points. 为了解山东省预防接种单位工作人员对流感、肺炎球菌、人乳头瘤病毒、带状疱疹、新型冠状病毒、乙肝等成人疫苗接种知识、态度、行为（KAP），于2022年8—9月，对山东省12县（市、区）797名成人预防接种单位工作人员进行了调查分析。结果显示，调查对象新型冠状病毒疫苗知识和态度总得分最高，M（Q1，Q3）为23（20，25）分和10（10，10）分，带状疱疹疫苗得分最低，分别为19（15，22）分和8（8，10）分。疫苗知识点“疫苗适用人群”得分最高，M（Q1，Q3）为26（23，30）分，“禁忌证/不良反应”及“不良反应处置”得分较低，总得分M（Q1，Q3）分别为24（20，29）分和24（20，28）分。89.71%调查对象2年内至少接种1种成人疫苗，53.58%接种者为自身内在认知驱动接种，认为“有必要接种”，66.00%未接种任何成人疫苗的调查对象对接种必要性认知不足，认为“自己身体健康，没必要接种疫苗”。综上，山东省成人预防接种单位工作人员在疫苗方面对带状疱疹疫苗总体认知不足，在成人预防接种知识点方面，对“禁忌证/不良反应及处置”认知相对较差。.",

        "abstract": "Infectious skin diseases constitute a significant public health problem. Despite the systematic development of many modern diagnostic and therapeutic tools, they still pose a serious challenge for clinicians. Due to their prevalence and mild course in most cases, they are often marginalized, which can delay their diagnosis and treatment initiation. Such an approach in more clinically advanced cases can have serious consequences, sometimes leading to tragic outcomes. This work presents a series of four cases of common infectious skin diseases with an unusually atypical clinical picture: the history of a 49-year-old female patient with recurrent erysipelas of the right lower leg co-occurring with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, a 75-year-old male patient with a generalized form of herpes zoster, a 38-year-old female patient with a complicated severe course of head lice, and a 34-year-old male patient with a severe form of post-steroid mycosis. In each of these cases, difficulties in making the correct diagnosis were highlighted, even though they represent some of the most common bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal dermatoses. The paper discusses the risk factors for these diseases, the pathophysiology of their atypical course, the effects and challenges in the therapeutic approach conducted. Infectious skin dermatoses require aggressive treatment and should never be underestimated. Choroby zakaźne skóry są istotnym problemem zdrowia publicznego. Pomimo systematycznego rozwoju nowoczesnych narzędzi diagnostycznych oraz terapeutycznych stanowią poważne wyzwanie dla klinicystów. Ze względu na swoją powszechność niejednokrotnie są marginalizowane, co może opóźniać diagnozę oraz wdrożenie leczenia. Takie postępowanie w bardziej zaawansowanych klinicznie przypadkach może mieć poważne, czasem tragiczne następstwa. W pracy prezentowana jest seria czterech przypadków częstych chorób zakaźnych skóry o wyjątkowo nietypowym obrazie klinicznym: 49-letniej pacjentki z różą nawrotową podudzia prawego współwystępującej z infekcją SARS-CoV-2, 75-letniego pacjenta z uogólnioną, ciężką formą półpaśca, 38-letniej pacjentki z wszawicą głowową oraz 34-letniego pacjenta z ciężką postacią grzybicy skóry głowy owłosionej (typu „incognito”). W każdym z wymienionych przypadków zaprezentowano problemy z ustaleniem prawidłowej diagnozy, pomimo, że reprezentują one powszechnie występujące dermatozy bakteryjne, wirusowe, pasożytnicze oraz grzybicze. W pracy zostały omówione czynniki ryzyka ww. chorób, patofizjologia ich nietypowego przebiegu, efekty oraz wyzwania w przeprowadzonym postępowaniu terapeutycznym. Dermatozy zakaźne skóry wymagają intensywnego leczenia i nie powinny być nigdy bagatelizowane.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway, holds promise as a therapeutic intervention for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, its use is associated with an increased risk of infections, particularly viral infections like herpes zoster (HZ). Results from the clinical trials on anifrolumab show yearly rates of upper respiratory tract infections of 34% and HZ of 6.1%. An increased frequency of other specific viral infections, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), was not reported. CASE REPORT Here, we present 2 cases of patients with SLE treated with anifrolumab, both experiencing severe adverse reactions in the form of disseminated herpesvirus infections, specifically disseminated HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV, HZ encephalitis). To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports of severe disseminated HSV-2 or HZ have been published in anifrolumab-treated patients. The patient in case 1 experienced a primary HSV-2 infection following anifrolumab treatment, potentially explaining the severity of the infection. The patient in case 2 had a history of previous HZ skin infections, which may have increased her risk of disseminated infection. Both patients recovered from the infections with minor sequelae, but they still require prophylactic antiviral treatment. These cases highlight the critical role of IFN-I immunity in protecting against herpesvirus infections. CONCLUSIONS Thorough risk assessment before anifrolumab initiation, considering the patient's viral infection history, vaccination status, and potential exposure risks, is essential. Administration of recombinant zoster vaccine before anifrolumab therapy may benefit susceptible individuals.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To assess the effectiveness and risk of intravitreal injection of dexamethasone implants in treating macular edema (ME) secondary to acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Methods:In this retrospective, noncomparative case series study, five patients who developed secondary ME after ARN and received an intravitreal dexamethasone implant injection were enrolled. The features of secondary ME on OCT and the outcomes of dexamethasone intravitreal implanting were presented. Results:The mean age of the patients was 59 years (range, 51-61 years). All patients had unilateral involvement, and all 5 eyes showed mild to moderate anterior uveitis, retinal necrosis, and vasculitis. Herpes zoster virus was detected in all eyes using PCR, and timely antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment was performed. Aqueous humor samples were negative for herpes zoster virus DNA, and resolution of viral retinitis was noted upon the occurrence of ME. Additionally, three eyes received pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil prior to ME development. All eyes presented with intraretinal fluid, hyper-reflective foci, and impairments of the external limiting membrane/ellipsoid zone at varying degrees on OCT images. Epiretinal membrane was exhibited in 80% of eyes, but no vitreoretinal traction was detected. Subretinal fluid was visible in 60% of eyes. ME was relieved effectively in all eyes after intravitreal dexamethasone implanting. One of these patients experienced three episodes of ME. No recurrence of retinal necrosis or corticosteroid-associated ocular hypertension was observed during the follow-up period. Conclusion:Intravitreal injection of dexamethasone implants can effectively alleviate ME secondary to ARN and improve visual acuity with no adverse reactions.",

        "abstract": "Context:Anecdotal evidence suggested that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may have imparted survivability to patients in osteopathic hospitals during the 1918 influenza pandemic. In addition, previous OMT research publications throughout the past century have shown evidence of increased lymphatic movement, resulting in improved immunologic function qualitatively and quantitatively. Objectives:The following is a description of a proposed protocol to evaluate OMT effects on antibody generation in the peripheral circulation in response to a vaccine and its possible use in the augmentation of various vaccines. This protocol will serve as a template for OMT vaccination studies, and by adhering to the gold standard of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), future studies utilizing this outline may contribute to the much-needed advancement of the scientific literature in this field. Methods:This manuscript intends to describe a protocol that will demonstrate increased antibody titers to a vaccine through OMT utilized in previous historical studies. Confirmation data will follow this manuscript validating the protocol. Study participants will be divided into groups with and without OMT with lymphatic pumps. Each group will receive the corresponding vaccine and have antibody titers measured against the specific vaccine pathogen drawn at determined intervals. Results:These results will be statistically evaluated. Our demonstration of a rational scientific OMT vaccine antibody augmentation will serve as the standard for such investigation that will be reported in the future. These vaccines could include COVID-19 mRNA, influenza, shingles, rabies, and various others. The antibody response to vaccines is the resulting conclusion of its administration. Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) lymphatic pumps have, in the past through anecdotal reports and smaller pilot studies, shown effectiveness on peripheral immune augmentation to vaccines. Conclusions:This described protocol will be the template for more extensive scientific studies supporting osteopathic medicine's benefit on vaccine response. The initial vaccine studies will include the COVID-19 mRNA, influenza, shingles, and rabies vaccines.",

        "title": "[Impact of the pandemic on various infectious diseases with different epidemiological patterns of seasonality, transmission and age]",
        "abstract": "Objective:The COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on other infectious diseases. The aim of this paper was to analyze the epidemiological changes that occurred during the pandemic in eight infectious diseases with different epidemiological patterns: influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, pneumococcus,Campylobacter, non-typhoidSalmonella, gonorrhea and herpes zoster. Methods:From the Microbiological Surveillance Network, the time series of cases was traced from January 2017 to March 2023. Three periods were distinguished: reference, pandemic and beginning of the post-pandemic. The distribution by age and sex in these periods was analyzed. Incidence rates and rate ratios (RR) were calculated. These RRs and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated overall and by year of age in children under five years of age. Results:Statistically significant differences were found in the impact that the pandemic had on each of these diseases. Some, after a period of epidemic silence, have revealed an intense post-pandemic rebound. The post-pandemic global RT increased for influenza (2.4), RSV (1.9) and gonorrhea (3.1); rotavirus recovered its pre-pandemic level (1.07); and pneumococcus (0.84),Campylobacter(0.83) andSalmonella(0.60) decreased. In children under 5 years of age, the patterns were specific and heterogeneous for each disease. Conclusions:The impact of the pandemic is very different in these diseases. Pediatric and respiratory-transmitted seasonal viral infections are the ones that are most affected, but with different patterns of recovery to normality. Gastrointestinal bacterial infections suffer fewer variations, except for rotavirus. Gonorrhea do not interrupt its increasing trend seen in the pre-pandemic. Shingles show a slight post-pandemic increase. Several diseases with different epidemiological patterns have been studied for a sufficient period to observe how the acute phase of the pandemic emerges. Objective:La pandemia de la COVID-19 ha tenido un fuerte impacto sobre otras enfermedades infecciosas. El objetivo de este trabajo fue analizar los cambios epidemiológicos acaecidos durante la pandemia en ocho enfermedades infecciosas con patrones epidemiológicos distintos: la gripe; virus respiratorio sincitial; rotavirus; neumococo;Campylobacter;Salmonellano tifoidea; gonococia; herpes zóster. Methods:A partir de la Red de Vigilancia Microbiológica, se trazó la serie temporal de casos desde enero de 2017 a marzo de 2023. Se distinguieron tres periodos: prepandemia (referencia), pandemia e inicio de la pospandemia. Se analizó la distribución por edad y sexo en esos periodos. Se calcularon las tasas de incidencia y las razones de tasas (RT). Se estimaron esas RT globales y sus intervalos de confianza al 95% por cada año de edad en menores de cinco años. Results:Se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas en el impacto que la pandemia tuvo en cada una de esas enfermedades. Algunas, tras un periodo de silencio epidémico, revelaron un repunte intenso pospandémico. Incrementaron la RT global postpandémica la gripe (2,4), VRS (1,9) y gonococia (3,1); recuperó su nivel prepandémico el rotavirus (1,07); y disminuyeron el neumococo (0,84),Campylobacter(0,83) ySalmonella(0,60). En menores de cinco años, los patrones fueron específicos y heterogéneos para cada enfermedad. Conclusions:El impacto de la pandemia es muy diferente en estas enfermedades. Las infecciones víricas estacionales pediátricas y de transmisión respiratoria son las que más se ven afectadas, pero con patrones de recuperación de la normalidad distintos. Las infecciones bacterianas gastrointestinales sufren menos variaciones, salvo el rotavirus. La gonococia no interrumpe su tendencia al aumento avistada ya en la prepandemia. El herpes zóster muestra un ligero incremento pospandémico. Se han estudiado varias enfermedades con distinto patrón epidemiológico durante un periodo suficiente para observar cómo se produce la salida de la fase aguda de la pandemia.",

        "abstract": "Background:This article presents a comprehensive review of data on the impact of facial palsy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The possible causes and pathophysiological mechanisms of changes in the epidemiology of facial palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed. Methods:This multicenter retrospective cohort study included 943 patients diagnosed with Bell's palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. This study compared patient demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and treatments before the COVID-19 pandemic (from 2017 to 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 2020 to 2022). Results:Following the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a significant increase in the number of cases of Bell's palsy, particularly among elderly individuals with diabetes. Bell's palsy increased after the COVID-19 outbreak, rising from 75.3% in the pre-COVID-19 era to 83.6% after the COVID-19 outbreak. The complete recovery rate decreased from 88.2% to 73.9%, and the rate of recurrence increased from 2.9% to 7.5% in patients with Bell's palsy. Ramsay Hunt syndrome showed fewer changes in clinical outcomes. Conclusion:This study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and management of facial palsy, and suggests potential associations with COVID-19. Notably, the observed increase in Bell's palsy cases among elderly individuals with diabetes emphasizes the impact of the pandemic. Identifying the epidemiological changes in facial palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic has important implications for assessing its etiology and pathological mechanisms of facial palsy disease.",

Secondly, sequelae of ARN, such as chronic anterior uveitis and cystoid macular edema, could be challenging to manage as steroid use in various forms poses a risk of virus reactivation. We present a case of ARN caused by varicella zoster virus with an initial confusing clinical picture with toxoplasma retinochoroiditis, documented with choroidal involvement. The patient also developed a chronic anterior uveitis with macular edema after resolution of ARN which was treated with topical interferon (IFN) alfa 2b therapy with successful outcome. This report supports the recently described choroidal involvement in ARN and suggests topical IFN as a novel treatment in management of chronic macular edema post ARN.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To summarize and analyze the effect of facial nerve decompression surgery for the treatment of Bell's palsy and Hunt syndrome.Methods:The clinical data of 65 patients with facial nerve palsy who underwent facial nerve decompression in our center from October 2015 to October 2022 were retrospectively analyzed, including 54 patients with Bell's palsy and 11 patients with Hunter syndrome. The degree of facial paralysis（HB grade） was evaluated before surgery, and ENoG, pure tone audiometry, temporal bone CT and other examinations were completed. All patients had facial palsy with HB grade V or above after conservative treatment for at least 1 month, and ENoG decreased by more than 90%. All patients underwent facial nerve decompression surgery through the transmastoid approach within 3 months after onset of symptoms. The recovery effect of facial nerve function after surgery in patients with Bell's palsy and Hunter syndrome was summarized and analyzed. In addition, 15 cases in group A（operated within 30-60 days after onset） and 50 cases in group B（operated within 61-90 days after onset） were grouped according to the course of the disease（the interval between onset of symptoms and surgery） to explore the effect of surgical timing on postoperative effect.Results:There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients with Chi-square test（P=0.54） in 42 patients（77.8%, 42/54） with Bell's palsy and 7 patients（63.6%, 7/11） in patients with Hunter syndrome who recovered to grade Ⅰ-Ⅱ. According to the course of the disease, 10 cases（66.7%, 10/15） in group A recovered to grade Ⅰ-Ⅱ after surgery. In group B, 39 patients（78.0%, 39/50） recovered to grade Ⅰ-Ⅱ after surgery, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups by Chi-square test（P=0.58）.Conclusion:Patients with Bell's palsy and Hunter syndrome can achieve good results after facial nerve decompression within 3 months of onset, and there is no significant difference in the surgical effect between the two types of patients. 目的：总结分析面神经减压术治疗贝尔面瘫和亨特综合征的效果。方法：回顾性分析2015年10月至2022年10月接受面神经减压术治疗的65例面神经麻痹患者的临床资料：贝尔面瘫54例，亨特综合征11例；术前评估患者面瘫程度（HB分级）并完成面神经电图（ENoG）、纯音测听、颞骨CT等检查。所有患者接受手术标准均为保守治疗至少1个月效果不佳，HB分级在Ⅳ级以上，ENoG下降超过90%，并且在发病3个月内接受经乳突入路面神经减压术。总结分析贝尔面瘫和亨特综合征两类患者术后面神经功能恢复效果；并且按病程（从发病到手术的间隔时间）分组：A组（发病30～60 d接受手术）15例，B组（发病61～90 d接受手术）50例，探讨手术时机对术后效果的影响。结果：贝尔面瘫患者术后恢复至Ⅰ～Ⅱ级42例（77.8%，42/54），亨特综合征患者术后恢复至Ⅰ～Ⅱ级7例（63.6%，7/11），经χ²检验（P=0.54）两类患者比较差异无统计学意义。按病程分组，A组术后恢复至Ⅰ～Ⅱ级10例（66.7%，10/15）；B组术后恢复至Ⅰ～Ⅱ级39例（78.0%，39/50），经χ²检验（P=0.58）2组患者比较差异无统计学意义。结论：贝尔面瘫和亨特综合征患者在发病3个月内接受面神经减压术均可获得良好效果，且两类患者手术效果无显著差异。.",

        "title": "Prognostic value of electroneurography using the midline method for predicting the development of synkinesis after peripheral facial palsy",
        "abstract": "Objective:The prognostic value of electroneurography (ENoG) for predicting the incidence of synkinesis is reportedly about 40 % using the formal standard method (ENoG-SM). However, the prognostic value of ENoG using the newly developed midline method (ENoG-MM) has not been determined. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the optimal prognostic value and advantages of ENoG-MM for predicting the incidence of synkinesis. Methods:Participants were 573 patients treated for peripheral facial palsy including Bell's palsy or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. We investigated the clinical presence of any oral-ocular or ocular-oral synkinesis from the medical records. ENoG-MM and ENoG-SM were performed 10-14 days after symptom onset. In ENoG-MM, compound muscle action potentials were recorded by placing the anode on the mental protuberance and the cathode on the philtrum. In ENoG-SM, electrodes were placed on the nasolabial fold. Synkinesis was clinically assessed at the end of follow-up or at >1 year after onset. The sensitivity and specificity of ENoG values for predicting the incidence of synkinesis were compared between ENoG-MM and ENoG-SM at every 5 % around 40 % (range, 30-50 %). Results:At every 5 % of ENoG values around 40 %, ENoG-MM provided higher sensitivity and lower specificity for predicting the incidence of synkinesis compared with ENoG-SM. In particular, when the cut-off value was set at 45 %, sensitivity was 100 % and 95.3 % with ENoG-MM and ENoG-SM, respectively. Conclusion:In peripheral facial palsy, ENoG-MM offered higher sensitivity than ENoG-SM for predicting synkinesis. ENoG-MM is useful for screening patients at risk of developing synkinesis. In clinical practice, an ENoG-MM cut-off value of 45 % must be the optimal prognostic value because of the 100 % sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Background:A wealth of extant research focuses on identifying barriers to, and predictors of, COVID-19 vaccination. In addition to treating COVID-19 vaccination and related experiences as antecedents, this study analyzes the relationships between COVID-19 vaccination experiences and intent to receive the flu, shingles, and HPV vaccines. Method:Analyses were performed on the responses from U.S. survey panel of 1,024 participants (n = 1,024), 530 (51.8 %) who received at least a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 494 (48.2 %) who had not. Descriptive and inferential statistics identify participant demographic characteristics, prior vaccination behavior, vaccination intentions, risk behavior assessment, vaccination attitudes and beliefs, and the predictivity of COVID-19 vaccination, when treated as an antecedent. Results:Receiving a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine interacted with receiving a past influenza vaccine, predicting the future intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine or booster. Vaccine hesitancy in parents is significantly related to vaccination behaviors for themselves and their children. Analyses also showed differences between the vaccinated group (VG) and the unvaccinated group (UVG) on hesitancy, beliefs, and attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion:Experience with COVID-19 vaccination and the relationship of those experiences with other vaccinations provide useful insight on leveraging vaccine uptake. Healthcare professionals should improve the COVID-19 vaccination experience and use vaccination appointments to promote other vaccinations. Research should continue to compare vaccination experiences and how they may persuade or dissuade vaccination intent for other vaccinations.",

        "abstract": "Older adults are more vulnerable to the negative impacts of infectious diseases than younger individuals. However, regardless of the importance and effectiveness of vaccines to reduce morbidity and mortality, issues remain with vaccine hesitancy among this population. Older adults' sources of immunization information and their level of trust in those sources may play a role in their vaccination behaviors. This research aimed to better understand the role of information sources and related issues of trust as related to vaccine uptake among older adults. A community-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted with 901 older adults in North Dakota in May-July 2022. Measures included extent of reliance on specific sources of immunization information, levels of trust, and uptake for influenza, pneumonia, shingles, and COVID-19 vaccinations. Immunization information sources were grouped into medical experts, informal, and public outlets. Results indicated older adults were more likely to rely on medical experts than informal sources or public outlets for immunization information. Greater reliance on medical experts was associated with a greater likelihood of vaccine uptake for all vaccines, while reliance on public outlets was associated with a greater likelihood of vaccine uptake only for COVID primary series and boosters. Reliance on informal sources for immunization information was associated with a reduced likelihood of vaccine uptake for all vaccines except shingles. Nearly half of respondents were uncertain who to trust for vaccine information. Uncertainty who to trust for immunization information significantly mediated the associations between reliance on medical experts and uptake for most vaccines indicating that trust in medical experts fosters vaccine uptake. Increasing reliance on medical experts as sources of immunization information is vital to increasing vaccine uptake among older adults. Additionally, this population must be assisted in increasing their ability to successfully assess the trustworthiness of immunization information sources.",

        "abstract": "Importance:The likelihood of benefit from a preventive intervention in an older adult depends on its time-to-benefit and the adult's life expectancy. For example, the time-to-benefit from cancer screening is >10 years, so adults with <10-year life expectancy are unlikely to benefit. Objective:To examine receipt of screening for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer and receipt of immunizations by 10-year life expectancy. Design:Analysis of 2019 National Health Interview Survey. Participants:8,329 non-institutionalized adults >65 years seen by a healthcare professional in the past year, representing 46.9 million US adults. Main measures:Proportions of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer screenings, and immunizations, were stratified by 10-year life expectancy, estimated using a validated mortality index. We used logistic regression to examine receipt of cancer screening and immunizations by life expectancy and sociodemographic factors. Key results:Overall, 54.7% of participants were female, 41.4% were >75 years, and 76.4% were non-Hispanic White. Overall, 71.5% reported being current with colorectal cancer screening, including 61.4% of those with <10-year life expectancy. Among women, 67.0% reported a screening mammogram in the past 2 years, including 42.8% with <10-year life expectancy. Among men, 56.8% reported prostate specific antigen screening in the past two years, including 48.3% with <10-year life expectancy. Reported receipt of immunizations varied from 72.0% for influenza, 68.8% for pneumococcus, 57.7% for tetanus, and 42.6% for shingles vaccination. Lower life expectancy was associated with decreased likelihood of cancer screening and shingles vaccination but with increased likelihood of pneumococcal vaccination. Conclusions:Despite the long time-to-benefit from cancer screening, in 2019 many US adults age >65 with <10-year life expectancy reported undergoing cancer screening while many did not receive immunizations with a shorter time-to-benefit. Interventions to improve individualization of preventive care based on older adults' life expectancy may improve care of older adults.",

        "abstract": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is an enveloped, linear double-stranded DNA virus. It belongs to the Herpesviridae family and can manifest as primary varicella infection or secondary infection, also known as herpes zoster. Varicella pneumonia is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening complication of primary varicella infection. It mainly affects adults, and, if left untreated, the mortality rate is high. We report two cases involving adult male patients who presented with a generalized widespread vesicular rash compatible with primary varicella. Each patient had a different clinical presentation; the first patient had respiratory symptoms, while the second patient did not. Chest radiographs of both patients showed bilateral infiltrates. Treatment was initiated with the administration of intravenous acyclovir with a very good response. This report of two cases highlights the importance of early detection and prompt treatment of varicella-related complications, especially in higher-risk patients, to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve overall clinical outcomes. We also aim to reinforce the importance of immunization, which would aid in reducing the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as varicella and its life-threatening complications.",

Methods:This retrospective study extracted the absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts (ANC and ALC, respectively) at the initial HZ date and up to 30 days before HZ. A follow-up survey was completed within 180 days of the onset of illness. Results:Patients with HZ showed higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lower ALC than the control at the initial date and had poorer prognosis. In the pre-onset examination, the maximum and minimum ALC values were significantly lower in patients with HZ than in the control, and the maximum ALC value in patients with HZ was lower than the minimum value in the control. The lowest ALC value was observed 7 days before the onset of HZ. An NLR value of 4.53 or more and ALC value of 0.64 × 109 cells/L or less were predictive markers of HZ development within 30 days. Patients who died after HZ had lower minimum ALC than those who survived longer. Limitations:The study had small population size, varying age distribution, and retrospective nature. The pre-onset data might have been exaggerated. Conclusion:HZ develops in a state of immune reconstitution with immunocompromised conditions, as part of the unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Lymphopenia prior to HZ onset is one of the most crucial factors in its pathogenesis and vital prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases stand as the leading cause of mortality among adults globally. For decades, comprehensive evidence has underscored the correlation between infections, particularly those involving the respiratory system, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, as well as all-cause mortality. The mechanisms through which infections heighten cardiovascular events are intricate, encompassing immune system activation, systemic inflammation, hypercoagulable states, sympathetic system activation, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Respiratory infections further contribute hypoxemia to this complex interplay. These mechanisms intertwine, giving rise to endothelial dysfunction, plaque ruptures, myocardial depression, and heart failure. They can either instigate de novo cardiovascular events or exacerbate pre-existing conditions. Compelling evidence supports the safety of influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease. Notably, the influenza vaccine has demonstrated safety even when administered during the acute phase of a myocardial infarction in individuals undergoing angioplasty. Beyond safety, these vaccinations significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events in individuals with an augmented cardiovascular risk. Nevertheless, vaccination rates remain markedly suboptimal. This manuscript delves into the intricate relationship between infections and cardiovascular events. Additionally, we highlight the role of vaccinations as a tool to mitigate these occurrences and reduce residual cardiovascular risk. Finally, we emphasize the imperative need to optimize vaccination rates among individuals with heart diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background:Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are predisposed to an increased risk of infection signifying the importance of vaccination to protect against its potentially severe complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (CDC/ACIP) issued immunization re-commendations to protect this patient population. Aim:To assess the adherence of patients with DM to the CDC/ACIP immunization recommendations in Saudi Arabia and to identify the factors associated with the vaccine adherence rate. Methods:An observational retrospective study conducted in 2023 was used to collect data on the vaccination records from 13 diabetes care centers in Saudi Arabia with 1000 eligible patients in phase I with data collected through chart review and 709 patients in phase II through online survey. Results:Among participants, 10.01% (n= 71) had never received any vaccine, while 85.89% (n= 609) received at least one dose of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, and 34.83% (n= 247) had received the annual influenza vaccine. Only 2.96% (n= 21), 2.11% (n= 15), and 1.12% (n= 8) received herpes zoster, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, respectively. For patients with DM in Saudi Arabia, the rate of vaccination for annual influenza and COVID-19 vaccines was higher compared to other vaccinations such as herpes zoster, Tdap, pneumococcal, and HPV. Factors such as vaccine recommendations provided by family physicians or specialists, site of care, income level, DM-related hospitalization history, residency site, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, and health sector type can significantly influence the vaccination rate in patients with DM. Among non-vaccinated patients with DM, the most reported barriers were lack of knowledge and fear of side effects. This signifies the need for large-scale research in this area to identify additional factors that might facilitate adherence to CDC/ACIP vaccine recommendations in patients with DM. Conclusion:In Saudi Arabia, patients with DM showed higher vaccination rates for annual influenza and COVID-19 vaccines compared to other vaccinations such as herpes zoster, Tdap, pneumococcal, and HPV. Factors such as vaccine recommendations provided by family physicians or specialists, the site of care, income level, DM-related hospitalization history, residency site, HbA1c level, and health sector type can significantly influence the vaccination rate in patients with DM.",

        "abstract": "Zoster-associated pain (ZAP) is a painful condition that significantly impacts a patient's quality of life, often leading to postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Over 30% of patients with herpes probably experience PHN. However, the understanding and treatment of ZAP remain inadequate. Common interventional treatments include radiofrequency therapy, nerve blocks, epidural block, and spinal cord electrical stimulation. Among these, radiofrequency therapy is widely used for pain control in ZAP, but the standard pulsed radiofrequency technique can still be improved. Researchers have explored different radiofrequency parameters, modes, targets, and combined treatments to enhance the therapeutic effect. In this paper, we review the latest research findings and incorporate our own departmental investigations. We conclude that high-voltage, long-duration pulsed radiofrequency and radiofrequency thermocoagulation therapy have shown improved therapeutic outcomes, despite some remaining limitations. Emphasis is placed on safety in intercostal nerve and extracranial nerve radiofrequency treatments. Combination therapy is also safe and effective; however, many studies have a low grade of evidence. Further high-quality research and systematic reviews are needed.",

        "abstract": "Background:This study aimed to determine the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and the risk of herpes zoster (HZ) incidence in patients with lung cancer. Method:We obtained national claims data of 51,021 patients from South Korea with lung cancer between August 2017 and December 2021. The study population was classified into ICI and non-ICI groups based on the prescription of ICIs at least once during the study period. To estimate the effects of ICIs treatment compared with those without ICIs treatment on HZ incidence, we used the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for sex, age, comorbidities, and concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs. Stratified analyses based on sex, age, and comorbidities were conducted to identify corresponding risk factors. Results:Of the 51,021 study participants, 897 (1.8%) were prescribed ICIs and 2262 (4.4%) were diagnosed with HZ. Approximately 75.6% of the patients receiving ICIs were male, and the prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease in the ICI group was significantly lower than that in the non-ICIs group. The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the probability of incidence of HZ in the ICIs group was lower than that in the non-ICIs group. Additionally, treatment with ICIs was associated with a 31% lower incidence of developing HZ when compared to that seen without ICIs treatment (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.00). This association was stronger in females (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.94) and those less than 68 years of age (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-0.99). Conclusions:In these real-world data from an Asian population with lung cancer, ICIs treatment might be associated with a reduced risk of HZ compared to that without ICIs treatment.",

        "abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus causing varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster. While varicella typically presents with a vesicular rash, latent VZV may reactivate within the sensory ganglia causing shingles, characterized by painful vesicular rash, which may lead to neurologic complications such as aseptic meningitis. This case explores an atypical presentation in an immunocompetent young man with VZV meningitis lacking the characteristic skin rash but featuring elevated intracranial pressure. A literature review revealed rare instances of VZV-related neurologic disease without typical skin manifestations, suggesting the virus's potential to affect the central nervous system directly. Treatment with intravenous acyclovir is recommended, with ganciclovir as an alternative treatment option. This case emphasizes the importance of considering VZV meningitis in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with viral meningitis symptoms, with or without dermatomal rash or immunocompromised conditions.",

In this case report, we discuss a case of a 55-year-old female with end-stage renal disease presenting with altered mental status and weakness. She was recently diagnosed with herpes zoster on oral acyclovir and multiple scattered dermatomal rashes on presentation. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis showed neutrophilic pleocytosis, high glucose and protein, and anti-VZV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. She was started on treatment early with acyclovir and demonstrated good clinical improvement afterward two weeks. This case highlights to importance of performing lumbar puncture and looking for anti-VZV antibodies to rule out encephalitis in patients with altered mental status and starting acyclovir treatment early.",

        "abstract": "Late opportunistic infections (OI) occurring beyond the first year after kidney transplantation (KT) are poorly described and not targeted by prophylactic strategies. We performed a ten-year retrospective monocentric cohort study describing epidemiology, risk factors and impact of late OI occurring 1 year after KT. We included clinically symptomatic OI requiring treatment besides BK virus nephropathy. Control groups included early OI occurring in the first year after KT, and KT recipients without OI since KT and alive with a functional allograft at 1 year. Among 1066 KT recipients, 185 (19.4%) presented a first episode of OI 21.0 (8.0-45.0) months after KT: 120 late OI (64.9%) and 65 early OI (35.1%). Late OI were mainly viral (N= 83, 69.2%), mostly herpes zoster (HZ) (N= 36, 43.4%). Pneumocystis represented most late fungal infections (N= 12/25, 48%). Compared to early OI, we reported more pneumocystis (p= 0.002) and less invasive aspergillosis (p= 0.01) among late OI. Patients with late OI were significatively younger at KT (54.0 ± 13.3 vs. 60.2 ± 14.3 years,p= 0.05). Patient and allograft survival rates between late OI and control groups were similar. Only age was independently associated with mortality. While late OI were not associated with higher mortality or graft loss, implementing prophylactic strategies might prevent such infections.",

        "abstract": "Chickenpox or varicella is a contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The virus is responsible for chickenpox (usually primary infection in non-immune hosts) and herpes zoster or shingles (following reactivation of latent infection). Chickenpox results in a skin rash forming small, itchy blisters that scabs over. It typically starts on the chest, back, and face and then spreads. It is accompanied by fever, fatigue, pharyngitis, and headaches, usually lasting 5 to 7 days. Complications include pneumonia, brain inflammation, and bacterial skin infections. The disease is more severe in adults than in children. Symptoms begin ten to 21 days after exposure, but the average incubation period is about 2 weeks (seeImage.Chickenpox [Varicella]). Chickenpox is an airborne disease spread worldwide by coughing, sneezing, and contact with skin lesions. It may spread 1 to 2 days before the rash appears until all lesions are crusted over. Patients with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through blister contact. The disease is diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Tests for antibodies may be performed to determine if immunity is present. Although reinfections by varicella may occur, these reinfections are usually asymptomatic and much milder than the primary infection. The varicella vaccine was introduced in 1995 and has significantly decreased the number of cases and complications. It prevents about 70% to 90% of infections and 95% of severe disease. Routine immunization of children is recommended. Immunization within 3 days of exposure may still improve outcomes in children.",

        "abstract": "Satellite glial cells (SGCs) are the main type of glial cells in sensory ganglia. Animal studies have shown that these cells play essential roles in both normal and disease states. In a large number of pain models, SGCs were activated and contributed to the pain behavior. Much less is known about SGCs in humans, but there is emerging recognition that SGCs in humans are altered in a variety of clinical states. The available data show that human SGCs share some essential features with SGCs in rodents, but many differences do exist. SGCs in DRG from patients suffering from common painful diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, may contribute to the pain phenotype. It was found that immunoglobulins G (IgG) from fibromyalgia patients can induce pain-like behavior in mice. Moreover, these IgGs bind preferentially to SGCs and activate them, which can sensitize the sensory neurons, causing nociception. In other human diseases, the evidence is not as direct as in fibromyalgia, but it has been found that an antibody from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis binds to mouse SGCs, which leads to the release of pronociceptive factors from them. Herpes zoster is another painful disease, and it appears that the zoster virus resides in SGCs, which acquire an abnormal morphology and may participate in the infection and pain generation. More work needs to be undertaken on SGCs in humans, and this review points to several promising avenues for better understanding disease mechanisms and developing effective pain therapies.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal varicella, arising from maternal infection with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), is a rare but potentially severe condition with diverse clinical presentations. This case report highlights an instance where the mother developed a maculopapular rash seven days before delivery, indicating a possible transmission of VZV to the neonate. The patient's family history included recent diagnoses of herpes zoster and varicella among household members. On the second day of life, the newborn developed a discrete vesicular rash on an erythematous background, affecting the trunk and neck. Due to the unavailability of varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered along with a seven-day course of intravenous acyclovir. Despite the absence of VZIG, the combined treatment with IVIG and acyclovir proved effective in resolving the rash by the sixth day of life, without any ensuing complications. This case underscores the challenges of managing neonatal varicella in resource-limited settings and suggests that combination therapy may not prevent the occurrence of neonatal varicella but can mitigate serious complications and expedite clinical recovery.",

        "abstract": "Background:Varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles) are outcomes of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, and understanding their incidence trends is vital for public health planning. Aim:To conduct an ambispective epidemiological study by analyzing the main epidemiological characteristics of VZV infection during an 18 year-period (2000-2018). Methods:We used descriptive and epidemiological methods to characterize chickenpox in Bulgaria, the city of Plovdiv and the region for a period of 18 years (2000-2018). Results:The average incidence of varicella-zoster infection for the period 2000-2018 in the Plovdiv region was estimated at 449.58‰. The highest relative share of the infection was assessed in the month of January at 13.6%, and the lowest in the months of August and September at 2.9% (both months). The age group most affected by the infection was 1-4 years, followed by 5-9 years. This corresponds to the so-called \"pro-epidemic population\" - a phenomenon typical for airborne infections, confirming their mass impact on the perpetuation of VZV infection. Conclusion:Our findings reveal significant insights into VZV epidemiology, including age-specific incidence rates, clinical manifestations, and vaccination impact. This comprehensive analysis contributes to the broader understanding of VZV infection dynamics and may inform evidence-based preventive measures.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To examine the frequency of recurrences, risk factors, and long-term clinical outcomes in subjects with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). Design:Retrospective cohort study. Methods:All subjects with acute HZO seen at a single center from 2006 to 2016 were included in the study. The primary outcome measure was eye disease recurrence. The secondary outcome measure was moderate vision loss (≤20/50). Results:A total of 869 patients with acute HZO were identified, with a median follow-up time of 6.3 years (interquartile range 3.7-8.9 years). In all, 551 recurrences were observed, and at least 1 recurrence was seen in 200 subjects (23.0%), with uveitis (34.8%) being the most common. The median time to first recurrence was 3.5 months. Predictors of disease recurrence included immunosuppression (P = .026), higher presenting intraocular pressure (P = .001), corneal involvement (P = .001), and uveitis (P < .001) on multivariate analysis. Topical steroids were initiated in the first month of presentation in 437 subjects, and recurrence was observed in 184 (42.1%) of these subjects. Following cessation of topical steroid treatment, recurrence occurred after a median of 1.4 months (90% within 7 months). Moderate vision loss (≤20/50) occurred in 15.5%, 28.6%, 31.4%, 50.0%, and 57.4% of eyes with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more recurrences. Conclusions:Recurrence of HZO eye disease is common, with an increased risk of vision loss with more recurrences. These findings indicate the need for close monitoring for potential recurrences, especially after cessation of topical steroid treatment, and in individuals with identified risk factors for recurrence.",

        "abstract": "Herpes stromal keratitis is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the western world. Infection by HSV1 is most common, but VZV and hCMV also infect the cornea. Multiple models of HSV1 corneal infection exist, but none for VZV and hCMV because of their host specificity. Here, we used commercially available 3D human corneal epithelial equivalents (HCEE) to study infection by these herpesviruses. HCEE was infected by HSV-1 and hCMV without requiring scarification and resulted in spreading infections. Spread of HSV-1 infection was rapid, while that of hCMV was slow. In contrast, infections with VZV required damage to the HCEE and did not spread. Acyclovir dramatically reduced replication of HSV-1 in this model. We conclude that highly quality-controlled, readily available HCEE is a useful model to study human-restricted herpesvirus infection of the human corneal epithelium and for screening of antiviral drugs for treating HSK in an 3D model system.",

The aim was to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the entire NIP in Spain, and an expanded NIP including four potential additional programs. A cost-benefit analysis was performed in Excel to assess the economic and health benefits (€) of vaccinating a single cohort of newborns over a lifetime horizon compared to no vaccination, from a societal perspective: firstly, according to the 2020 NIP in Spain (including 2021 recommendation for herpes zoster in 65-year-olds); and secondly, with an expanded NIP (adding rotavirus and meningococcal B in infants, and pertussis booster in adults aged >65 years and herpes zoster in all adults >50 years). The main inputs were taken from published literature and Spanish databases. Results were presented as a benefit-cost ratio (economic benefit per €1 invested). A cohort of 343,126 newborns were included in the analysis. The total investment needed to vaccinate the cohort throughout their lifetime, according to the 2020 NIP and the expanded NIP, was estimated at €168.5 million and €275.5 million, respectively. Potential economic benefits were €772.2 million and €803.0 million, respectively. The societal benefit-cost ratio was €4.58 and €2.91 per €1 invested, respectively. Even with the addition of new vaccination programs, the Spanish NIP yielded positive benefit-cost ratios from the societal perspective, demonstrating that NIPs spanning the full life course are an efficient public health measure.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Uveitis and scleritis may be caused by local or systemic infection, or associated with noninfectious systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. This study explored the all-cause mortality following an individual's first presentation with uveitis/scleritis. Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted on all uveitis/scleritis patients diagnosed by uveitis specialists and treated in a single tertiary referral center in New Zealand between 2006 and 2020(15y). Masquerade syndromes including intraocular lymphoma were excluded. Outcome measures: demographics, etiology of uveitis/scleritis, anatomical location and all-cause mortality. Results:2723 subjects were identified. Median age of onset of uveitis/scleritis was 44.9 years (Range:1.5-99.5 years). 49.6% were female. Median follow-up from diagnosis of uveitis/scleritis was 8.0 years (IQR 4.1-11.6 years) with a total follow-up of 24 443.3 subject-years. The most frequent diagnosis was idiopathic disease (30.9%), HLA-B27-positive uveitis (20.0%), and sarcoidosis (4.7%). Infectious etiologies (24.1%) were most commonly from herpes zoster virus (9.3%) and toxoplasmosis (4.3%). The age-adjusted mortality rate was higher in subjects with idiopathic disease, sarcoidosis, Fuchs' uveitis syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis/ANCA-associated vasculitis, toxoplasmosis, and herpes zoster virus, when compared to HLA-B27-positive uveitis. Hazard of mortality peaked in the first seven years following diagnosis, then subsequently declined. Patients with uveitis/scleritis had a significantly higher rate of mortality compared to the general New Zealand population (IRR 1.656p= 0.017). Conclusion:Infectious etiologies of uveitis/scleritis in this cohort were high when compared to other developed nations, attributable to data from a tertiary referral center treating inpatients. Potential shared inflammatory mechanisms in the eye and other organs can lead to concurrent non-ocular disease requiring systemic treatment, impacting an individual's longevity.",

        "abstract": "Systemic treatments are important for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis; however, they may occasionally cause adverse infectious events. Although the risk of severe infections with psoriatic treatments is well established, little is known about cutaneous infections. Therefore, we studied the frequency of cutaneous infections in patients with psoriasis who underwent biologic treatment. A total of 878 patients (237 females and 641 males) were analyzed in this follow-up survey conducted in 2020 and based on the Western Japan Psoriasis Registry. The observed skin phenotypes were psoriasis vulgaris (83.3%), pustular psoriasis (7.5%), and psoriatic arthritis (28.9%). The most frequently prescribed systemic drug was apremilast (11.3%), followed by ixekizumab (11.0%), risankizumab (10.9%), and secukinumab (10.4%). The incidence of cutaneous bacterial infections was 12 (1.37% of the total patients), with cellulitis being the most common (8/12, 67%). The incidence of viral infections was 11 (1.25%) including the most common, herpes zoster (9/11, 82%); and that of fungal infections was 45 (5.13%) including 33 (73%) and seven (16%) patients with trichophytosis and oral candidiasis, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that cutaneous bacterial infections were frequently observed in patients receiving tumor necrosis factor-α (odds raio [OR] 9.917, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.069-47.572, p = 0.004) and interleukin (IL)-17 (OR 10.798, 95% CI 2.35-49.616, p = 0.002) inhibitor treatments. A history of otitis media and treatment with oral medications (OR 4.50, 95% CI 1.281-15.804, p = 0.019 and OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.141-12.679, p = 0.03 respectively) were associated with a higher ORs for cutaneous viral infections. Furthermore, age and use of IL-17 inhibitors were associated with elevated ORs for fungal infections. In conclusion, our study reveals that systemic therapies may increase the risk of cutaneous viral infections. Therefore, dermatologists should exercise caution in this regard.",

        "abstract": "Background:Diagnosis codes and prescription data are used in algorithms to identify postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a debilitating complication of herpes zoster (HZ). Because of the questionable accuracy of codes and prescription data, manual chart review is sometimes used to identify PHN in electronic health records (EHRs), which can be costly and time-consuming. Objective:This study aims to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for automatically identifying PHN from unstructured EHR data and to compare its performance with that of code-based methods. Methods:This retrospective study used EHR data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a large integrated health care system that serves over 4.8 million members. The source population included members aged ≥50 years who received an incident HZ diagnosis and accompanying antiviral prescription between 2018 and 2020 and had ≥1 encounter within 90-180 days of the incident HZ diagnosis. The study team manually reviewed the EHR and identified PHN cases. For NLP development and validation, 500 and 800 random samples from the source population were selected, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of NLP and the code-based methods were evaluated using chart-reviewed results as the reference standard. Results:The NLP algorithm identified PHN cases with a 90.9% sensitivity, 98.5% specificity, 82% PPV, and 99.3% NPV. The composite scores of the NLP algorithm were 0.89 (F-score) and 0.85 (MCC). The prevalences of PHN in the validation data were 6.9% (reference standard), 7.6% (NLP), and 5.4%-13.1% (code-based). The code-based methods achieved a 52.7%-61.8% sensitivity, 89.8%-98.4% specificity, 27.6%-72.1% PPV, and 96.3%-97.1% NPV. The F-scores and MCCs ranged between 0.45 and 0.59 and between 0.32 and 0.61, respectively. Conclusions:The automated NLP-based approach identified PHN cases from the EHR with good accuracy. This method could be useful in population-based PHN research.",

        "abstract": "β-l-5-((E)-2-Bromovinyl)-1-((2S,4S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-(dioxolane-4-yl) uracil (l-BHDU,17) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). l-BHDU (17) has demonstrated excellentanti-VZV activity and is a preclinical candidate to treat chickenpox, shingles (herpes zoster), and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infections. Its monophosphate prodrug (POM-l-BHDU-MP,24) demonstrated an enhanced pharmacokinetic and antiviral profile. POM-l-BHDU-MP (24),in vivo, effectively reduced the VZV viral load and was effective for the topical treatment of VZV and HSV-1 infections. Therefore, a viable synthetic procedure for developing POM-l-BHDU-MP (24) is needed. In this article, an efficient approach for the synthesis of l-BHDU (17) from a readily available starting material is described in 7 steps. An efficient and practical methodology for both chiral pure l- & d-dioxolane11and13were developedviadiastereomeric chiral amine salt formation. Neutralization of the amine carboxylate salt of l-dioxolane10provides enantiomerically pure l-dioxane11(ee ≥ 99%). Optically pure11was utilized to construct the final nucleoside l-BHDU (17) and its monophosphate ester prodrug (POM-l-BHDU-MP,24). Notably, the reported process eliminates expensive chiral chromatography for the synthesis of chiral pure l- & d-dioxolane, which offers avenues for the development and structure-activity relationship studies of l- & d-dioxolane-derived nucleosides.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Vaccines for prevention against varicella are important for adolescents and adults, who have an increased risk of severe varicella. This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a two-dose immunization schedule of a live-attenuated varicella vaccine (VarV) manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian) in healthy adolescents and adults. Methods:A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted in healthy population aged ≥ 13 years old in China. Participants in block 1 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two doses of either the test vaccine or an active control vaccine, administered 4, 6 or 8 weeks apart. Participants in block 2 were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive two doses of test vaccine or placebo, administered 10 weeks apart. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the seroconversion rates and GMTs of varicella zoster virus (VZV) antibodies measured by fluorescent-antibody-to-membrane-antigen (FAMA) 4 weeks post-immunization. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of adverse reactions within 4 weeks after each dose. Results:A total of 2398 participants were enrolled. The seroconversion rates of VZV antibodies were 79.55 % in the test group and 76.41 % in the active control group respectively 4 weeks after two doses of pooled schedule, with the difference of 3.14 % (95 %CI: -0.69 %, 6.97 %). The GMTs were 1:162.07 and 1:160.04 respectively, with the ratio of 1.013 (95 %CI: 0.910, 1.127). Both the seroconversion rates and GMTs reached the prespecified non-inferiority criteria. Two-dose schedule with an interval of 10 weeks could also induce high immune responses, with a seroconversion rate of 83.22 % and a GMT of 1:160.38 in the test group. Safety profiles were similar among the test group, active control group and placebo group. Conclusion:VarV, manufactured by Sinovac (Dalian), demonstrated higher immune response and better flexibility in the immunization schedule among heathy population aged 13 years and older, without increased safety risk.",

        "abstract": "Background:This study sought to assess the risk factors of herpes zoster (HZ) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with tofacitinib (TOFA). Methods:This retrospective study reviewed RA patients receiving TOFA. We compared clinical characteristics, laboratory profiles, concomitant medication use, and HZ incidence in patients with and without recent biologic synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) treatment, which is defined as their administration ≤ 180 days prior to the initiation of TOFA treatment. We used univariate Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess risk factors. Results:Among 304 RA patients, 97 had recent bDMARDs use and 207 did not. Patients with recent bDMARDs use typically had lower weekly doses of methotrexate, less hydroxychloroquine use, and shorter follow-up times. In the recent bDMARDs group, 64 (66.0%) used tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), 19 (19.6%) used tocilizumab, and 14 (14.4%) used abatacept. The overall incidence rate (IR) of HZ was 5.62 per 100 person-years. Patients with recent bDMARDs use exhibited a higher HZ risk compared to those without recent bDMARDs use (IR ratio: 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-5.19, p = 0.028). Recent bDMARDs use (hazard ratio: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.12-4.95, p = 0.024) was an independent risk factor for HZ among multivariable analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed increased HZ risk in RA patients on TOFA with recent bDMARDs use (log-rank p = 0.015). Conclusion:HZ is common in RA patients treated with TOFA, and recent bDMARDs (TNFi, tocilizumab and abatacept) use is a risk factor of HZ. HZ vaccination, therefore, should be recommended for this group.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Anti-herpesvirus drug-induced encephalopathy can complicate herpes zoster treatment; however, the association between the recently developed anti-herpesvirus drug amenamevir and encephalopathy development remains unknown. Determining the characteristics of amenamevir-induced encephalopathy is essential for potentially improving patient outcomes in the treatment of herpes zoster. The aim of this study is to identify the association between amenamevir treatment and encephalopathy and to determine the risk factors for amenamevir-induced encephalopathy via disproportionality analysis using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Method:We conducted a retrospective observational study using anonymized data from the JADER database. Encephalopathy was defined according to the Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Queries specific to \"Noninfectious encephalopathy/delirium.\" Disproportionality analysis was used to calculate the reporting odds ratios (RORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations between amenamevir and encephalopathy. Multivariable logistic regression considered age, gender, chronic kidney disease, and cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor use as potential risk factors. Results:Out of 713,316 patients, 246 were prescribed amenamevir. The median onset of encephalopathy in these patients was 3 days. Disproportionality of encephalopathy was observed in patients treated with amenamevir (ROR, 3.44; 95 % CI, 2.48-4.78). Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that an age of ≥70 years was associated with amenamevir-induced encephalopathy (ROR, 7.63; 95 % CI, 2.25-25.9). Conclusion:These results suggest that amenamevir treatment may be associated with encephalopathy, particularly in patients aged ≥70 years. Healthcare providers should be aware of this potential risk, especially in elderly patients, to prevent severe central nervous system complications.",

        "abstract": "Background:Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) is characterized by its ability to enter a dormant state within the body. When the wild or vaccine virus reactivates, it can lead to herpes zoster (HZ), which infrequently manifests as a neuroinfection. Objectives:The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical manifestations and outcomes associated with VZV reactivation in the CNS in immunocompetent children. Methods:We searched medical databases for case reports using the keywords \"zoster\", \"meningitis\", \"encephalitis\", and \"immunocompetent\". The inclusion criteria were age below 18 years, any gender, race, and ethnicity, no features or history of immunodeficiency, and confirmation of VZV reactivation through the detection of VZV DNA in the CSF. Patients were categorized into two groups: children experiencing the reactivation of the wild virus and children with the vaccine strain virus. Results:The cohort included six children hospitalized in our hospital and 49 children reported in the literature. In 37 (67%), a wild-type virus was detected, while in 18 (33%), an infection was caused by the vaccine strain. There were no differences in the clinical presentation between the two groups. A typical rash was observed in 32 (58%) children. Approximately 41 of the 55 children (75%) received antiviral treatment. Four patients experienced complications. Conclusions:Neither a history of VZV immunization nor the absence of a skin rash can definitively exclude VZV meningitis. It is important to note that any seemingly healthy child, regardless of recognized risk factors, could develop HZ meningitis.",

        "abstract": "Background:In Korea, there are no surveillance programs for vaccines that are not included in the national immunization program (NIP), and vaccine safety monitoring in the adult population is inadequate. This study aimed to establish a safety monitoring system for non-NIP vaccines in adults. Methods:Frequently administered non-NIP vaccines were selected. Individuals were included if they received at least one of the selected vaccines at a participating institution and provided informed consent. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were monitored using questionnaires sent through text messages on days 1, 3, 7, 28, and 90 post-vaccination. Selected adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were monitored monthly by retrospective review of electronic medical records. Causality was assessed according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency guidelines. Results:Four vaccines (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis [Tdap], pneumococcal conjugate 13-valent [PCV13], live zoster vaccine [ZVL], and recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]) were selected, and their safety profiles were monitored at four tertiary hospitals and 10 primary care clinics. The response rates of the questionnaires on post-vaccination days 1, 7, 28, and 90 were 99.2%, 93.6%, 81.0%, and 48.7%, respectively. Of 555 AESI identified over 10 months, 10 cases received one of the selected non-NIP vaccines within 90 days of the event. Conclusion:We are establishing the first safety monitoring system for selected non-NIP vaccines in Korea since September 2022 and report its progress as of July 2023. However, continuous government support is essential for its maintenance and improvement.",

        "abstract": "This is a case report of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) uveitis confirmed via aqueous humor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomics. This 72-year-old male with a history of diabetes and herpes zoster complained of redness and blurred vision in his right eye for eight months. Mild conjunctival injection, anterior chamber cells, mutton-fat keratic precipitates, and vitreous haze were noted. Fluorescein angiography revealed dye leakage from retinal vessels without retinal ischemic changes. Only the serum anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG was positive while the aqueous humor PCR for VZV (Varicella-zoster virus), HSV (Herpes simplex viruses), CMV, and EBV was initially negative. Inflammation recurred and vitreous haze worsened after discontinuing nine-month topical ganciclovir and oral prednisolone. the aqueous humor PCR was repeated due to persistent low-grade inflammation. The EBV PCR turned out to be positive. Shotgun metagenomics revealed 1459 classified sequences (1.62%) and confirmed the EBV infection. Topical ganciclovir and methylprednisolone treatment was resumed. Conjunctival injection improved while pigmented keratic precipitates lessened. Elderly patients with diabetes or under immunosuppression may be susceptible to chronic uveitis associated with subsequent EBV infection. Repeated aqueous humor PCR and shotgun metagenomics are important tools in the diagnosis of this case of chronic indolent panuveitis.",

Results:A 68-year-old woman with a history of herpes zoster without ocular involvement presented with panuveitis in her right eye two weeks after a UV light lock-in treatment for a recently implanted LAL. An infectious and inflammatory workup was only notable for positive HSV-1 and VZV IgG, but the patient did not have any history of ocular HSV or VZV. Over the course of five months, the panuveitis resolved completely with topical steroids and the patient had a good visual outcome. Conclusion:Though causality cannot be established in this case, physicians should be aware of the possibility of uveitis after UV light treatments. Extra caution should be observed in patients with history of herpetic disease.",

They act as a bridge between microbe sensing, immune function magnitude, and adaptive immunity to fight infections, and they must therefore be tightly regulated. It has become increasingly evident that thymic irregularities and mutations in immune genes affecting thymic tolerance can lead to the production of IFN-I autoantibodies (autoAbs). Whether these biomarkers affect the immune system or tissue integrity of the host is still controversial, but new data show that IFN-I autoAbs may increase susceptibility to severe disease caused by certain viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, herpes zoster, and varicella pneumonia. In this article, we will elaborate on disorders that have been identified with IFN-I autoAbs, discuss models of how tolerance to IFN-Is is lost, and explain the consequences for the host.",

Although anifrolumab has not been indicated for cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), multiple cases and case series (20 publications with a total of 78 patients) have shown good and rapid responses with this drug, both in subacute CLE and discoid lupus erythematosus, as well as in lupus panniculitis and perniosis. Two case reports of dermatomyositis have also experienced clinical improvement with anifrolumab. Clinical trials of this drug are ongoing for subacute CLE and discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and progressive vitiligo. Its most common adverse effects are respiratory infections and herpes zoster. Anifrolumab may be a well-tolerated alternative in the management of CLE.",

In 2 clinical trials, it has proven effective to treat cutaneous signs. Although anifrolumab has not been indicated for cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), multiple cases and case series (20 publications with a total of 78 patients) have shown good and rapid responses with this drug, both in subacute CLE and discoid lupus erythematosus, as well as in lupus panniculitis and perniosis. Two case reports of dermatomyositis have also experienced clinical improvement with anifrolumab. Clinical trials of this drug are ongoing for subacute CLE and discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and progressive vitiligo. Its most common adverse effects are respiratory infections and herpes zoster. Anifrolumab may be a well-tolerated alternative in the management of CLE.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Pain is one of the most common and harmful symptoms experienced by individuals with acute herpetic neuralgia (AHN). In this population, studies to determine the causes that affect patients taking medications compliance are rare. This study aimed to construct a predictive model for medication compliance of patients with AHN and to verify its performance. Design and methods:In this prospective study of 398 patients with AHN who were discharged from a tertiary hospital with medications from July 2020 to October 2022, we used logistic regression analysis to explore the predictive factors of medication compliance of patients with AHN and to construct a nomogram. The area under the curve was used to evaluate the predictive effect of the model. Results:A predictive model of drug compliance of patients with AHN was constructed based on the following four factors: disease duration, pain severity before treatment, medication beliefs, and comorbidity of chronic diseases. The area under the curve of the model was 0.766 (95% confidence interval [0.713, 0.819]), with a maximum Youden's index of 0.431, sensitivity of 0.776, and specificity of 0.655. A linear calibration curve was found with a slope close to 1. Conclusions:The prediction model constructed in this study had good predictive performance and provided a reference for early clinical screening of independent factors that affected the medication compliance of patients with AHN.",

        "abstract": "Biologics and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are immunomodulating and immunosuppressing medications utilized to treat atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriasis (PSO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and alopecia areata (AA). Special recommendations must be considered when prescribing vaccinations in this population, as the pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccine are recommended to patients ≥ 19-years-old (rather than ≥ 65-years-old and ≥ 50-years-old as in the general population, respectively), along with a yearly influenza and up to date COVID-19 vaccination. Additionally, TNF-α and JAK-inhibitors may increase the risk of latent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation among high-risk patients. Prior to prescribing these medications, a quantitative HepB Surface Antibody (HepB SA) test is performed to determine immunity. This study utilized the SlicerDicer function on EPIC Medical Records to search for any patient ≥ 19-years-old prescribed a biologic or JAK inhibitor for AD, PSO, PsA, or AA between 10/2003 and 10/2023 at a large tertiary institution. Vaccination rates among patients on biologics and JAK inhibitors were low, with rates being significantly lower in patients 19-64 years-old, compared to those ≥ 65 years-old for most disease states (p < 0.01). Among AD, PSO/PsA, and AA patients, on average, 9.39% were vaccinated for influenza, 6.76% for herpes zoster, 16.56% for pneumococcal pneumonia, and 63.98% for COVID-19. Only 3.16% of patients were adequately vaccinated for HepB after an abnormal HepB SA test. Here, extremely low rates of vaccination among patients on biologics and JAK inhibitors at our institution were highlighted, emphasizing the imperative need for ensuring vaccination in this group.",

        "abstract": "Background:Exanthems are a common reason for visits to the pediatric emergency department. However, epidemiological data in the post-measles-rubella vaccine era is limited. Objective:We sought to determine the recent causes of exanthems in children younger than 6 years old in the pediatric emergency department. Methods:A prospective single-center study was conducted in Japan from August 2019 to March 2020. Children younger than 6 years old with exanthems were enrolled. Exanthems were classified into 7 morphological patterns. Varicella, herpes zoster, impetigo, urticaria and Kawasaki disease were diagnosed clinically. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from patients with nonspecific exanthems and evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays capable of detecting 24 pathogens. The final diagnosis was made by discussion of 3 physicians based on clinical course and microbiology. Results:There were 9705 pediatric visits, of which 296 (3%) had exanthems and were younger than 6 years old. Clinical diagnosis was possible for 160 (54%), including urticaria in 110 (37%), Kawasaki disease in 29 (10%), impetigo in 10 (3%), varicella or herpes zoster in 7 (2%) and group A Streptococcus in 4 (1%). Among the remaining 136 (46%) children, 75 (25%) underwent testing by PCR. One or more pathogens were detected in 49 (65%), specifically enterovirus in 14 (19%), cytomegalovirus in 13 (17%), human herpesvirus type-6 in 12 (16%), adenovirus in 11 (15%) and human herpesvirus type-7 in 8 (11%). Final infectious disease diagnoses were roseola infantum in 11 (15%), enterovirus in 9 (12%), adenovirus in 6 (8%), mixed virus infection in 5 (7%), group A Streptococcus in 3 (4%), parechovirus-A in 3 (4%) and influenza in 3 (4%). Conclusions:The most common causes of pediatric exanthems were noninfectious diseases and viral exanthema. PCR assay was instrumental for etiological diagnosis of nonspecific exanthems.",

        "abstract": "Background:The objective of this study is to estimate the burden of selected immunization-preventable infectious diseases in Spain using the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) methodology, as well as focusing on the national immunization programme and potential new inclusions. Methods:The BCoDE methodology relies on an incidence and pathogen-based approach to calculate disease burden via disability-adjusted life year (DALY) estimates. It considers short and long-term sequelae associated to an infection via outcome trees. The BCoDE toolkit was used to populate those trees with Spanish-specific incidence estimates, and de novo outcome trees were developed for four infections (herpes zoster, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and varicella) not covered by the toolkit. Age/sex specific incidences were estimated based on data from the Spanish Network of Epidemiological Surveillance; hospitalisation and mortality rates were collected from the Minimum Basic Data Set. A literature review was performed to design the de novo models and obtain the rest of the parameters. The methodology, assumptions, data inputs and results were validated by a group of experts in epidemiology and disease modelling, immunization and public health policy. Results:The total burden of disease amounted to 163.54 annual DALYs/100,000 population. Among the selected twelve diseases, respiratory infections represented around 90% of the total burden. Influenza exhibited the highest burden, with 110.00 DALYs/100,000 population, followed by invasive pneumococcal disease and RSV, with 25.20 and 10.57 DALYs/100,000 population, respectively. Herpes zoster, invasive meningococcal disease, invasive Haemophilus influenza infection and hepatitis B virus infection ranked lower with fewer than 10 DALYs/100,000 population each, while the rest of the infections had a limited burden (< 1 DALY/100,000 population). A higher burden of disease was observed in the elderly (≥ 60 years) and children < 5 years, with influenza being the main cause. In infants < 1 year, RSV represented the greatest burden. Conclusions:Aligned with the BCoDE study, the results of this analysis show a persisting high burden of immunization-preventable respiratory infections in Spain and, for the first time, highlight a high number of DALYs due to RSV. These estimates provide a basis to guide prevention strategies and make public health decisions to prioritise interventions and allocate healthcare resources in Spain.",

        "abstract": "Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that has been associated with numerous immune-mediated adverse effects. Several of these cutaneous side effects may include bullous pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Other case reports have reported DRESS as a rare side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors but due to its variable presentation and similarities with other cutaneous diseases, it has proven to be a diagnostic challenge. In addition, no effective methods have been developed to monitor for such adverse skin reactions in patients on immunotherapy. Here, we report a diagnostic challenging case of pembrolizumab-induced blistering lesions that were initially treated as suspected Herpes zoster and/or bullous pemphigoid but further pathology was consistent with DRESS.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complication of herpes zoster, significantly impacts the quality of life of affected patients. Research indicates that early intervention for pain can reduce the occurrence or severity of PHN. This study aims to develop a predictive model and scoring table to identify patients at risk of developing PHN following acute herpetic neuralgia, facilitating informed clinical decision-making. Methods:We conducted a retrospective review of 524 hospitalized patients with herpes zoster at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University from December 2020 to December 2023 and classified them according to whether they had PHN, collecting a comprehensive set of 30 patient characteristics and disease-related indicators, 5 comorbidity indicators, 2 disease score values, and 10 serological indicators. Relevant features associated with PHN were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Then, the patients were divided into a training set and a test set in a 4:1 ratio, with comparability tested using univariate analysis. Six models were established in the training set using machine learning methods: support vector machines, logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting, and neural network. The performance of these models was evaluated in the test set, and a nomogram based on logistic regression was used to create a PHN prediction score table. Results:Eight non-zero characteristic variables selected from the LASSO regression results were included in the model, including age [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.812, p < 0.001], Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (AUC = 0.792, p < 0.001), receiving treatment time (AUC = 0.612, p < 0.001), rash recovery time (AUC = 0.680, p < 0.001), history of malignant tumor (AUC = 0.539, p < 0.001), history of diabetes (AUC = 0.638, p < 0.001), varicella-zoster virus immunoglobulin M (AUC = 0.620, p < 0.001), and serum nerve-specific enolase (AUC = 0.659, p < 0,001). The gradient boosting model outperformed other classifier models on the test set with an AUC of 0.931, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.882-0.980), accuracy of 0.886 (95% CI 0.809-0.940). In the test set, our predictive scoring table achieved an AUC of 0.820 (95% CI 0.869-0.970) with accuracy of 0.790 (95% CI 0.700-0.864). Conclusion:This study presents a methodology for predicting the development of postherpetic neuralgia in shingles patients by analyzing historical case data, employing various machine learning techniques, and selecting the optimal model through comparative analysis. In addition, a logistic regression model has been used to create a scoring table for predicting the postherpetic neuralgia.",

        "title": "The effect of herpes zoster vaccination at different stages of the disease course of dementia: Two quasi-randomized studies",
        "abstract": "The varicella zoster virus, a neurotropic herpesvirus, has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of dementia, such as through neuroinflammatory processes or intracerebral vasculopathy. Using unique natural experiments, our group has previously found that live-attenuated herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination reduced the incidence of new diagnoses of dementia in both Wales and Australia. To inform further research and ultimately clinical care, it is crucial to understand at which stage of the disease course of dementia the HZ vaccine has its effect. Representing the two opposing ends of the dementia disease course as it can be ascertained from electronic health record data, the aims of this study were twofold: to determine the effect of HZ vaccination on i) new diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among individuals without any record of cognitive impairment, and ii) deaths due to dementia among individuals living with dementia. Our approach took advantage of the fact that at the time of the start date (September 1 2013) of the HZ vaccination program in Wales, individuals who had their eightieth birthday just after this date were eligible for HZ vaccination for one year whereas those who had their eightieth birthday just before were ineligible and remained ineligible for life. This eligibility rule created comparison groups just on either side of the September 2 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold who differed in their age by merely a week but had a large difference in their probability of receiving HZ vaccination. The key strength of our study is that these comparison groups should be similar in their health characteristics and behaviors except for a minute difference in age. We used regression discontinuity analysis to estimate the difference in our outcomes between individuals born just on either side of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold for HZ vaccination. Our dataset consisted of detailed country-wide electronic health record data from primary care in Wales, linked to hospital records and death certificates. We restricted our dataset to individuals born between September 1 1925 and September 1 1942. Among our study cohort of 282,557 without any record of cognitive impairment at baseline, HZ vaccination eligibility and receipt reduced the incidence of a new MCI diagnosis by 1.5 (95% CI: 0.5 - 2.9, p=0.006) and 3.1 (95% CI: 1.0 - 6.2, p=0.007) percentage points over nine years, respectively. Similarly, among our study cohort of 14,350 individuals who were living with dementia at baseline, being eligible for and receiving HZ vaccination reduced deaths due to dementia by 8.5 (95% CI: 0.6 - 18.5, p=0.036) and 29.5 (95% CI: 0.6 - 62.9, p=0.046) percentage points over nine years, respectively. Except for dementia, HZ vaccination did not have an effect on any of the ten most common causes of morbidity and mortality among adults aged 70 years and older in Wales in either of our two study cohorts. The protective effects of HZ vaccination for both MCI and deaths due to dementia were larger among women than men. Our findings suggest that the live-attenuated HZ vaccine has benefits for the dementia disease process at both ends of the disease course of dementia.",

        "abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) poses lifelong risks, causing varicella and herpes zoster (HZ, shingles). Currently, varicella and HZ vaccines are predominantly live attenuated vaccines or adjuvanted subunit vaccines utilizing VZV glycoprotein E (gE). Here, we propose our vaccine candidates involving a comparative analysis between recombinant baculoviral vector vaccines (AcHERV) and a live attenuated vaccine strain, vOka. AcHERV vaccine candidates were categorized into groups encoding gE only, VZV glycoprotein B (gB) only, or both gE and gB (gE-gB) as AcHERV-gE, AcHERV-gB, and AcHERV-gE-gB, respectively. Humoral immune responses were evaluated by analyzing total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and neutralizing antibodies. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profiling. In the mouse model, AcHERV-gE-gB elicited similar or higher total IgG, IgG2a, and neutralizing antibody levels than vOka and showed robust VZV-specific CMI responses. From the perspective of antigens encoded in vaccines and their relationship with CMI response, both AcHERV-gB and AcHERV-gE-gB demonstrated results equal to or superior to AcHERV-gE, encoding only gE. Taken together, these results suggest that AcHERV-gE-gB can be a novel candidate for alleviating risks of live attenuated vaccine-induced latency and effectively preventing varicella during early stages of life while providing strong CMI for effective resistance against HZ and therapeutic potential in later stages of life.",

        "abstract": "Alphaherpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), infect a diverse array of hosts, spanning both humans and animals. Alphaherpesviruses have developed a well-adapted relationship with their hosts through long-term evolution. Some alphaherpesviruses exhibit a typical neurotropic characteristic, which has garnered widespread attention and in-depth research. Virus latency involves the retention of viral genomes without producing infectious viruses. However, under stress, this can be reversed, resulting in lytic infection. Such reactivation events can lead to recurrent infections, manifesting as diseases like herpes labialis, genital herpes, and herpes zoster. Reactivation is a complex process influenced by both viral and host factors, and identifying how latency and reactivation work is vital to developing new antiviral therapies. Recent research highlights a complex interaction among the virus, neurons, and the immune system in regulating alphaherpesvirus latency and reactivation. Neurotropic alphaherpesviruses can breach host barriers to infect neurons, proliferate extensively within their cell bodies, and establish latent infections or spread further. Whether infecting neurons or spreading further, the virus undergoes transmission along axons or dendrites, making this process an indispensable part of the viral life cycle and a critical factor influencing the virus's invasion of the nervous system. Research on the transmission process of neurotropic alphaherpesviruses within neurons can not only deepen our understanding of the virus but can also facilitate the targeted development of corresponding vaccines. This review concentrates on the relationship between the transmission, latency, and activation of alphaherpesviruses within neurons, summarizes recent advancements in the field, and discusses how these findings can inform the design of live virus vaccines for alphaherpesviruses.",

        "abstract": "Background:Several Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been developed in recent years. These agents are widely applicable in clinical practice as an alternative treatment for immune-mediated diseases. While the safety and efficacy profile of these drugs has been evaluated in several randomized clinical trials and studies, very few authors have assessed safety and effectiveness under the real-world conditions of daily clinical practice. Objective:This study aims to describe the effectiveness and safety of JAK inhibitors in daily clinical practice for the treatment of immune-mediated rheumatic diseases in a university hospital. Methods:We performed a single-center observational, descriptive, retrospective study of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) receiving active treatment with JAK inhibitors between March 2022 and February 2023. We recorded study variables from the clinical history for subsequent analysis using STATA 12.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). A 95% confidence interval was applied. Results:The final analysis was performed on 64 patients (upadacitinib: 27, baricitinib: 16, tofacitinib: 13, filgotinib: eight), with a mean age of 55.69±10.78 years (60.94% females). The distribution by disease was as follows: RA, 44 (70.31%); SpA, 11 (17.18%); and PsA, eight (12.5%). A significant improvement was observed in all groups at six to 12 months, as follows: RA, remission in 48.89% and low activity in 26.67%; SpA, remission in 9.09% and low activity in 54.54%; and PsA, low activity in 87.5%. The factors most associated with poor response to treatment were activity before initiation of treatment and previous failure of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Adverse effects and complications were detected in 26.56% (SARS-CoV-2, one case; basal cell carcinoma, one case; and herpes zoster, two cases). There were no reports of cardiovascular or thromboembolic events, opportunistic infection, or tuberculosis. Conclusions:Our real-world data show that treatment with JAK inhibitors leads to a high rate of remission/low activity that remains unchanged at six to 12 months in RA, SpA, and PsA. The predictors of a poor response to JAK inhibitors in our study population were the level of activity before initiation of treatment and previous failure of bDMARDs. No cardiovascular or thromboembolic events were reported. Of note, we did record one case of severe infection, one case of basal cell carcinoma, and two cases of herpes zoster.",

        "abstract": "Background:The efficacy and safety of the oral Janus kinase inhibitor peficitinib were investigated in Asian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods:In this double-blind, phase 3 study, patients from mainland China, Korea, and Taiwan with RA and an inadequate response/intolerance to methotrexate were randomized (1:1:1) to once-daily placebo (N = 128), peficitinib 100 mg (N = 129), or 150 mg (N = 128) in combination with non-biologic DMARDs. At Week 24, patients receiving placebo switched to peficitinib 100 mg or 150 mg. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at Week 24/early termination (ET) was the primary endpoint. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials (NCT03660059). Findings:385 patients were included in the analysis. ACR20 responses were statistically significantly higher in both peficitinib 100 mg (56.6%) and 150 mg (56.3%) groups versus placebo (24.2%); Odds Ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) 4.14 (2.42, 7.08) and 4.07 (2.38, 6.96), respectively (both P < 0.001) at Week 24/ET. The incidence rate of herpes zoster related disease (herpes zoster and varicella) was higher in patients who received peficitinib versus placebo, but no dose dependency was observed (incidence rate/100 patient-years (95% CI): peficitinib 6.7 (4.32, 10.37); placebo 3.7 (0.93, 14.88). Interpretation:In Asian patients with RA and an inadequate response/intolerance to methotrexate, peficitinib 100 mg and 150 mg demonstrated superiority to placebo in the reduction of RA symptoms and was well tolerated. No additional benefit was observed with use of the higher peficitinib dose in this study population of predominantly Chinese patients. Funding:Astellas Pharma.",

        "abstract": "Herpes simplex and herpes zoster are both viral infections caused by members of the herpesvirus family. The former is characterized by painful, fluid-filled blisters or sores on the skin and mucous membranes, while the latter presents as a painful rash with blisters, typically occurring in a single band or patch along one side of the body. The treatment remains a challenge since current antiviral therapy via oral administration may lead to unfavorable side effects such as headaches, nausea, and diarrhea. This study used electrospinning to develop biodegradable nanofibrous poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) membranes for delivery of both acyclovir and ketorolac. The structure of the spun nanofibers was assessed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the appearance of loaded acyclovir and ketorolac in the nanofibers was confirmed with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Release profiles of these drugs from the nanofibrous membranes were assessed using in vitro elution studies, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays, and in vivo drug release patterns. The electrospun nanofibers had a size range of 283-725 nm in diameter, resembling the extracellular matrix of natural tissue and demonstrated excellent flexibility and extensibility. Notably, the drug-eluting nanofibers exhibited an extended release of high levels of acyclovir and ketorolac over a 21-day period. Thus, biodegradable drug-eluting membranes with a prolonged drug release could be a potential therapeutic approach for treating herpes infections.",

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a painful ulcerative skin disorder that is associated with neutrophilic dysfunction. However, the pathophysiologies of keloids and PG are not fully understood. The authors encountered an unusual case of a 24-year-old woman who presented with an anterior chest keloid that bore an ulcer. The keloid was resected along with the ulcer, and histology revealed the ulcer to be a neutrophilic PG ulcer. A year after surgery, another ulcer developed in the scar. The ulcer met the PARACELSUS criteria of a postsurgical PG ulcer. After treatment with systemic prednisone and adalimumab for 250 days, the ulcer re-epithelialized. However, relapsed keloids were then observed at the PG site. Corticosteroid taping may be the safest therapy for patients with a history of PG. Conversely, if there is suspicion that a patient is prone to keloid development, diagnostic biopsies and surgical management of PG ulcers should be avoided or conducted with care.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:The use of novel adjuvants in human vaccines continues to expand as their contribution to preventing disease in challenging populations and caused by complex pathogens is increasingly understood. AS01 is a family of liposome-based vaccine Adjuvant Systems containing two immunostimulants: 3-O-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A and the saponin QS-21. AS01-containing vaccines have been approved and administered to millions of individuals worldwide. Areas covered:Here, we report advances in our understanding of the mode of action of AS01 that contributed to the development of efficacious vaccines preventing disease due to malaria, herpes zoster, and respiratory syncytial virus. AS01 induces early innate immune activation that induces T cell-mediated and antibody-mediated responses with optimized functional characteristics and induction of immune memory. AS01-containing vaccines appear relatively impervious to baseline immune status translating into high efficacy across populations. Currently licensed AS01-containing vaccines have shown acceptable safety profiles in clinical trials and post-marketing settings. Expert opinion:Initial expectations that adjuvantation with AS01 could support effective vaccine responses and contribute to disease control have been realized. Investigation of the utility of AS01 in vaccines to prevent other challenging diseases, such as tuberculosis, is ongoing, together with efforts to fully define its mechanisms of action in different vaccine settings.",

However, the mechanisms by which VZV establishes latency in the sensory ganglia and disseminates to these sites remain unclear. Methods:We combined a single-cell sequencing approach and a well-established rhesus macaque experimental model using Simian varicella virus (SVV), which recapitulates the VZV infection in humans, to define the acute immune response to SVV in the lung as well as compare the transcriptome of infected and bystander lung-resident T cells and macrophages. Results and discussion:Our analysis showed a decrease in the frequency of alveolar macrophages concomitant with an increase in that of infiltrating macrophages expressing antiviral genes as well as proliferating T cells, effector CD8 T cells, and T cells expressing granzyme A (GZMA) shortly after infection. Moreover, infected T cells harbored higher numbers of viral transcripts compared to infected macrophages. Furthermore, genes associated with cellular metabolism (glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation) showed differential expression in infected cells, suggesting adaptations to support viral replication. Overall, these data suggest that SVV infection remodels the transcriptome of bystander and infected lung-resident T cells and macrophages.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of live attenuated zoster vaccination on stroke and myocardial infarction risk in patients at risk of zoster, including those with hypertension, diabetes mellites, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, asthma, and chronic liver disease. Methods:This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing continuous de-identified claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (collected from 2005-2018) containing data for 200 million commercially insured Americans. Participants included 27,093 adults vaccinated against zoster with at least 5 years of continuous enrollment, age and sex-matched 1:5 with unvaccinated controls. OR, risk difference, and the number needed to treat evaluated the effect of vaccination on stroke and myocardial infarction while controlling for relevant comorbidities. Results:Over the period of 5 years, proportions of myocardial infarction (1.29% vs 1.82%; p<0.05) and stroke (1.61% vs 2.20%; p<0.05) were lower in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals, respectively, controlling for age and sex, with the greatest benefit for people with diabetes (stroke OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.58, 0.71; myocardial infarction OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.57, 0.71). Although hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had the highest odds of stroke and myocardial infarction, vaccination still provided significant risk-reduction (hypertension: stroke 0.75 [0.68, 0.83], myocardial infarction 0.73 [0.65, 0.81]; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: stroke 0.75 [0.68, 0.83], myocardial infarction 0.74 [0.66, 0.83]). Conclusions:Live attenuated zoster vaccination is associated with lower risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in adults with at-risk comorbidities, controlling for age and sex. Vaccination may provide cardiovascular benefits beyond zoster prevention.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To assess safety of baricitinib in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis in real-world clinical practice. Methods:This all-case post-marketing surveillance study included patients initiating baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis from September 2017 to April 2019. Treatment duration was recorded. Safety data were collected for up to 3 years from baricitinib initiation (up to 4 weeks post discontinuation in discontinuing patients). Results:Safety analyses included 4720 patients; 2580 (54.7%) were ≥65 years old. Baricitinib persistence rate was 45.4% (3 year Kaplan-Meier analysis); the most common discontinuation reason was insufficient effectiveness (n = 1005, 21.3%). Serious adverse events occurred in 600 patients (incidence rate 10.42/100 patient-years; 95% confidence interval, 9.76-11.09). There were 39 deaths (incidence rate 0.43 [0.30-0.57]/100 patient-years). Incidence rate per 100 patient-years for adverse events of special interest were herpes zoster 4.68 (4.22-5.14), serious infection 3.05 (2.68-3.41), malignancy 1.09 (0.87-1.30), major adverse cardiovascular events 0.35 (0.23-0.48) and venous thromboembolism 0.25 (0.15-0.36). Incidence rates did not increase with prolonged exposure. Conclusions:No new safety concerns were identified during this 3 year post-marketing surveillance study of baricitinib in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients and clinicians should be cognizant of herpes zoster and other serious infection risks during baricitinib treatment, especially in the first 6 months.",

        "abstract": "Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, has been shown to have lower thromboembolism rates compared to placebo in polycythemia vera (PV) patients. This meta-analysis evaluates ruxolitinib's efficacy and safety against best available therapy (BAT) in patients with PV and in hydroxyurea-resistant/intolerant PV patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to November 2023. We compared ruxolitinib and BAT for efficacy and safety endpoints. Six studies involving 1061 patients were analyzed, with 620 on BAT and 441 on ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib showed higher hematocrit control (p = 0.015) and treatment response (p = 0.04) compared to BAT. It also significantly improved Myeloproliferative Neoplasms-Symptom Assessment Form scores (MPN-SAF) (p < 0.01). Additionally, patients with PV treated with ruxolitinib had higher rates of nonmelanoma skin cancer (p < 0.01). In subgroup analyses focusing on patients resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea, ruxolitinib maintained its efficacy, significantly improving treatment response (p < 0.01) and significant improvements in MPN-SAF (p = 0.02) score when compared to BAT. The safety profile was consistent with the overall analyses, showing significantly reduced thromboembolism rates (p = 0.04), increased rates of anemia (p = 0.01), and increased herpes zoster infections (p = 0.02). Ruxolitinib outperforms BAT in PV and patients with PV-resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea, offering better hematocrit control and reducing symptomatic burden and thromboembolism risk. Yet, it is associated with higher rates of anemia, herpes infection, and skin cancer.",

        "title": "Herpes zoster vaccination and new diagnoses of dementia: A quasi-randomized study in Australia",
        "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that neurotropic herpesviruses could play a role in the development of dementia, possibly through a neuroinflammatory process. Herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination has been reported to lead to a reduced probability of being diagnosed with dementia in several correlational studies and in a prior analysis by our team in Wales. This present study constitutes the first investigation to use a quasi-randomized study design in an electronic health record dataset from a large and diverse nation (Australia) to aim to determine the effect of HZ vaccination on dementia. In Australia, starting on November 1 2016, live-attenuated HZ vaccination was provided for free to individuals aged 70 to 79 years of age through primary care providers. Thus, those whose 80thbirthday was just a few days prior to November 1 2016 never became eligible, whereas those whose 80thbirthday was just a few days later were eligible. The key advantage of our approach is that one would not expect that these population groups who differ in their age by only a minute degree would, on average, differ in any of their health characteristics and behaviors. We used detailed primary healthcare records with week-of-birth information from 65 general practices across Australia. We analyzed our data using a regression discontinuity approach. Our sample consisted of 101,219 patients. As expected, patients born just before versus shortly after the date-of-birth eligibility threshold (November 2 1936) for HZ vaccination were well-balanced in their past preventive health services uptake and chronic disease diagnoses. There was an abrupt increase of 15.7 (95% CI: [12.2 - 19.3], p < 0.001) percentage points in the probability of ever receiving HZ vaccination between patients born shortly before versus shortly after the eligibility threshold. The eligibility rules of the HZ vaccination program, thus, created comparison groups just on either side of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold who were similar to each other, except for a large difference in their probability of receiving the intervention (HZ vaccination) of interest. Eligibility for HZ vaccination (i.e., being born shortly before versus shortly after November 2 1936) decreased the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis over 7.4 years by 2.0 percentage points (95% CI: [0.3 - 3.7], p = 0.021). Being eligible for HZ vaccination did not affect the probability of taking up other preventive health services (including other vaccinations), nor the probability of being diagnosed with other common chronic conditions than dementia. This study provides important evidence on the potential benefits of HZ vaccination for dementia because its quasi-randomized design allows for conclusions that are more likely to be causal than those of the existing associational evidence.",

        "abstract": "Background.Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a human neurotropic virus which commonly causes infection during childhood, presenting as chickenpox. Later in life it may reactivate as herpes zoster. We report a rare manifestation of reactivation of VZV infection presenting as cutaneous vasculitis and varicella pneumonia in a lung transplant recipient.Case presentation.A 65-year-old man was lung transplanted bilaterally for emphysema and had repeated posttransplant chest infections and colonization withPseudomonas aeruginosa. Nine months post-transplant he presented with dyspnoea and a cutaneous vasculitis-like eruption with a predilection over face, thorax and distal extremities. Initially, VZV reactivation was not suspected due to absence of the typical vesicular eruptions. The diagnosis was confirmed by VZV PCR from the swabs of the ulcer after skin punch biopsy of a lesion and from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The histology of skin biopsy demonstrated epithelial damage and vascular damage but no typical epithelial virus associated changes. The patient responded to antiviral therapy with total remission of rash and VZV DNA was finally not detectable from repeated BAL after 29 days of therapy. However, the pulmonary radiological features and dyspnoea persisted due to reasons possibly unrelated to the VZV infection.Conclusion.Had it not been for the patient to mention the resemblance of the vasculitic rash with his primary VZV infection, the diagnosis would easily have been overlooked. In this case, the biopsy did not show typical histopathologic findings of VZV-vasculitis. What led the diagnosis was a PCR from the wound swab taken after the punch biopsy. This case serves as a reminder for atypical presentation of common conditions in immunosuppressed patients and that extensive diagnostic sampling may be warranted in this group.",

        "abstract": "Background and aims:The treatment for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) continues to be challenging in clinical pain management. Paravertebral block (PVB) and erector-spinae block (ESPB) are two novel techniques for treating this distressing condition. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of PVB and ESPB in preventing the progression to PHN in patients with acute herpes zoster (AHZ). Material and methods:Sixty patients in pain due to AHZ were selected for a prospective randomized control study after approval from Institutional Ethical Committee. Written informed consent was taken. Patients were randomized and allotted into Control-group: standard treatment (oral antivirals, analgesics, neuropathic medicines); PVB-Group: standard treatment with PVB and ESPB- Group: standard treatment with ESPB. Under ultrasound guidance, both blocks were administered with 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine + dexamethasone 8 mg. Efficacy was evaluated on the 15th, 30th, and 60thday post treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with adequate relief from pain and allodynia post study. Results:The incidence of PHN post study was 45% in the ESPB group and 40% in the PVB group and 80% in the control group (p= 0.022). The proportion of patients with pain relief was higher among the PVB group compared to the ESPB group but not statistically significant (p0.749). On day 60, the mean pain score was 2.45 (±3.05) and 2.15 (±2.7) in ESPB and PVB groups, respectively, and 4.3 (±2.27) in the control group (p0.003). Conclusion:PVB and ESPB are effective approaches in treating patients suffering from pain due to acute zoster and help in preventing its progression to PHN.",

For the influenza vaccine, a recommendation for enhanced vaccines for the elderly was added. For the herpes zoster vaccine, a recommendation for the recombinant zoster vaccine was added. For the pneumococcal vaccine, the current status of the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 20-valent PCV was described. For the Tdap vaccine, the possibility of using Tdap instead of tetanus-diphtheria vaccine was described. For the HPV vaccine, the expansion of the eligible age for vaccination was described. For the meningococcal vaccine, a recommendation for the meningococcal B vaccine was added. For the rabies vaccine, the number of pre-exposure prophylaxis doses was changed. This manuscript documents the summary and rationale of the revisions for the seven vaccines. For the vaccines not mentioned in this manuscript, the recommendations in the 3rd edition of theVaccinations for Adultstextbook shall remain in effect.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Zoster-associated pain (ZAP) treatment and management is still inadequate. Repeated intervention protocol is often applied to manage ZAP. This study aimed to retrospectively investigate the effect of repeated applications of pulsed radiofrequency therapy on controlling acute/subacute ZAP. Methods:From March 2019 to December 2021, 150 patients with acute/subacute ZAP who underwent repeated application of pulsed radiofrequency treatment (R-PRF) and pulsed radiofrequency combined paravertebral block interventions (PRF + PVB) in the Pain Department of the affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University were enrolled. Patients were grouped by intervention protocol and received at least 12 months of follow-up assessments using the Numerical Rating Scale score (NRSs), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Simple McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 score (SF-MPQ-2s), and follow-up interventions. Results:Both groups experienced a reduction in the incidence of clinically meaningful ZAP after the intervention therapy. In the R-PRF group, there were 36 cases of clinically meaningful ZAP within the first month post-treatment, while the PRF + PVB group had 38 cases. The incidence of clinically meaningful ZAP, as determined by multivariable generalized estimating equations, was 42.86% in the R-PRF group and 57.58% in the PRF + PVB group during the first month of follow-up. There was a significant difference in the incidence of clinically meaningful ZAP between the two groups after 1 month of treatment (adjusted odds ratio: 0.40; 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.91; p = 0.03). Conclusions:Both R-PRF and PRF + PVB treatments effectively relieve pain in patients with acute/subacute ZAP. However, R-PRF may have superior efficacy compared to PRF + PVB in reducing the incidence of clinically meaningful ZAP 1 month after treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:The aim of this study was to update previously estimated public health impact and cost effectiveness of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) for the prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) in Canadians aged ≥50 years using longer-term RZV efficacy and waning data and real-world coverage and completion. Methods:A multicohort Markov model was used to conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing RZV with no HZ vaccination among Canadians aged ≥50 years. Real-world data were used for first-dose coverage (17.5%) and second-dose completion (65%). Vaccine efficacy and waning data were applied from up to 8-year follow-up from the ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 clinical trials. Incremental costs and benefits were calculated using a lifetime horizon from the healthcare payer (base case) and societal perspectives. A discount rate of 1.5% was applied to costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results:The model estimated that RZV would prevent 303,835 HZ cases, 83,256 post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) cases, 39,653 other complications, and 99 HZ-related deaths compared with no HZ vaccination. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated to be $27,486 and $22,097 per QALY (2022 Canadian dollars [CAN$]) from the healthcare payer and societal perspectives, respectively. The base-case ICER was most sensitive to a lower percentage of initial HZ cases with PHN. Almost all probabilistic sensitivity analysis simulations (98.1%) resulted in ICERs <CAN$50,000 per QALY. Conclusions:RZV is expected to remain a cost-effective option for Canadian adults aged ≥50 years when using longer-term RZV efficacy and waning estimates, although the estimated public health impact was smaller than in the previous analysis (due to lower coverage/completion estimates).",

        "abstract": "Purpose:The Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS) is the first randomized clinical trial to study the efficacy of long-term (1 year) suppressive valacyclovir treatment on herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) outcomes. This article details the baseline characteristics of participants. Setting:The study was set at 95 participating clinical centers in 33 states, Canada, and New Zealand. Study population:Immunocompetent adults with a history of a characteristic HZO unilateral rash and documentation of an episode of active dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, or iritis within the preceding year, enrolled in ZEDS from November 2017 to January 2023. Intervention:Participants were randomized to double-masked oral valacyclovir 1 gm daily versus placebo for 1 year of treatment and followed for 18 months. Results:Five hundred twenty-seven participants were enrolled across 4 strata according to age at HZO onset (younger or older than 60 years) and duration of HZO at enrollment (less or greater than 6 months), with an even distribution of men and women and a median age of 60 years. More participants with recent (57%, 300/527) than chronic HZO and younger than 60 years at HZO onset (54%, 286/527) were enrolled. Most participants were treated acutely with a recommended antiviral regimen (91%, 480/527) and had not been vaccinated against zoster (79%, 418/527). Conclusions:The broad ZEDS study population enhances the likelihood that ZEDS will provide generalizable high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of suppressive valacyclovir for HZO immunocompetent adults and whether it should become standard of care.

        "abstract": "Purpose of review:Advances in oncological therapies have resulted in an increase in the number of patients living with and beyond cancer. The personal and societal impact of chronic pain in the survivor population represents an area of significant unmet need. Capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) may provide analgesia with limited systemic side effects. This review looks to summarise the most recent evidence regarding the use of capsaicin in the management of cancer pain. Recent findings:Various international guidelines have recently endorsed the use of high concentration capsaicin patches in the treatment of chronic painful chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. Numerous studies support the use of capsaicin in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. This promising data is predominantly yielded from pain secondary to herpes zoster and diabetic neuropathy, with an expanding but small evidence base for its utility in other neuropathic pains. Emerging data suggests that treatments are better tolerated and provide analgesia more rapidly when compared with systemic treatments. Summary:Whilst randomised controlled trial data in the treatment of cancer pain are lacking, recent large cohort studies, and international guidelines, support the use of high concentration capsaicin patches in a wide variety of neuropathic pain secondary to cancer treatments.",

Observation:A 74-year-old female with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presented with isolated periorbital nSS that closely mimicked necrotizing fasciitis (NF); she displayed pathergy to debridement, was exquisitely responsive to corticosteroids, and underwent successful first-stage reconstruction of the eyelid with full-thickness skin grafting. A second 40-year-old female patient with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) presented with multifocal nSS most prominently involving the eyelid. Positive herpes zoster virus (HSV) PCR and bacterial superinfection complicated the diagnosis. She improved with chemotherapy for AML and corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion:nSS is rare and a high level of clinical suspicion as well as an understanding of its distinguishing features is necessary to avoid undue morbidity. Identification of pathergy, histopathology, microbiology, and clinical context are critical to avoid misdiagnosis of infection.",

        "abstract": "Background:Patients with cancer present a higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. Recommended vaccinations are the most cost-effective measure to reduce the risk of transmission and related complications. Nevertheless, vaccination rates are inadequate. Oncologists have a central role in tailored vaccine communication to their patients. We present the results of a survey conducted by AIOM in 2022, focusing on the perception of the problem by oncologists. Materials and methods:An anonymous 31-item online questionnaire was shared on 15 September 2022 on the AIOM website. The objectives of this survey were to examine the perception of Italian oncologists on vaccine-preventable diseases and the main available vaccines, their attitude towards recommending vaccines and the COVID-19 pandemic impact on their habits regarding vaccine-preventable diseases. Results:Between September 2022 and January 2023, 114 medical oncologists (5% of the members) completed the anonymous questionnaire. At the first oncological visit, only 30% of respondents usually propose a vaccination schedule to all their patient, 41% do not usually discuss vaccinations at the first visit and 29% recommend vaccines exclusively to specific categories of patients. For 56% of respondents, patients are more aware of the benefits of vaccines, whereas 36% reported that patients are worried of receiving too many vaccines. Conclusion:This is the first survey conducted among Italian oncologists to better understand the perception and attitudes towards the vaccination. It highlights the urgent issues of educating and training oncologists in vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccine awareness and the need to build (or implement) a network of multidisciplinary collaborations.",

Until recently, pharmacists have been limited to prescribing Schedule 2 and 3 medications, and optometrists, podiatrists, and nurse practitioners can prescribe medications under their scope of practice in some areas of Australia. Recently, the New South Wales (NSW) Government initiated a trial where approved pharmacists in NSW and Australian Capital Territory have an expanded scope of practice to prescribe further medications for urinary tract infections, dermatology conditions (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, herpes zoster (shingles), impetigo, and mild plaque psoriasis), and resupply of contraceptives. This protocol is for a sub-study of the larger research trial and will explore the perspectives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities including clinicians, healthcare services, and community members about the expanded scope of pharmacists' practice.Methods and analysisYarning circles (group) and individual yarns (semi-structured interviews) will be conducted with leaders, clinicians working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (general practitioners, nurses, Aboriginal health workers, community pharmacists), Aboriginal Elders, and community members to understand perspectives of the risks, benefits, opportunities, and issues associated with pharmacists prescribing for these specific conditions. Ethics approval was obtained through the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council of NSW.ConclusionThe findings of this sub-study will clarify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' unique perspectives, including perception of risks and opportunities.",

        "abstract": "Background Immunomodulatory therapy for chronic rheumatic disease carries a risk for infectious complications. In Bangladesh, there is limited information regarding patterns and factors associated with infections among patients receiving immunosuppressive medications. Objective The present study aimed to find out patterns and predictors associated with infection among patients who were on different immunosuppressive medications due to chronic rheumatological disease. Methodology This was a retrospective study; all confirmed cases of (new and old) different rheumatological diseases on disease-modifying agents attended at the rheumatology clinic of Dhaka Medical College Hospital from January 2019 to December 2021 were enrolled. Result Among 489 cases, 90 (18.4%) patients had documented infections. The most common rheumatological diseases were systemic lupus erythematosus (28, 31.1%), ankylosing spondylitis (26, 28.8%), and rheumatoid arthritis (20, 22.2%). COVID-19 (28, 31.1%) was the most commonly occurring infection followed by urinary tract infection (14, 15.6%), fungal infection (12, 13.3%), herpes zoster (10, 11.1%), pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) (eight, 8.8%), latent TB (seven, 7.7%), community-acquired pneumonia (six, 6.6%), and sepsis (three, 3.3%). Infection was most prevalent among patients who received steroids of more than 10 mg per day (17, 18.8%) than those less than 10 mg steroid per day (six, 6.7%), Factors associated with infections were (odds ratio, 95% CI, p-value) underweight (2.3, [1.3-2.7], 0.001), anemia (1.8, [1.1-5.7], 0.01), neutropenia (1.6, [1.1-2.9], <0.002), hypoalbuminemia (3.1, [1.6-4.9], 0.001), hypovitaminosis D (1.9, [1.3-4.5], 0.001), high blood sugar (1.5, [1.1-5.3], 0.02), inadequate counseling of steroid side effect (1.7, [1.1-3.9], 0.03), prednisolone >10mg/day (2.2, [1.19-4.10], 0.001). Conclusion COVID-19 pneumonia, urinary tract infections, fungal infection, tuberculosis, herpes zoster, and community-acquired pneumonia were commonly occurring infections among patients receiving different immunosuppressive medications. Factors like poor nutritional status, presence of anemia, leucopenia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia, and hypovitaminosis D had a significant association with infection. Moreover, inadequate counseling of steroid side effects and history of daily intake of prednisolone (>10mg/day) were also significant factors associated with infection.",

        "abstract": "HIV infection alters the skin microbiome and predisposes to a wide range of cutaneous infections, from atypical presentations of common skin infections to severe disseminated infections involving the skin that are AIDS-defining illnesses. Bacterial infection of the skin, most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, occurs frequently and can result in bacteremia. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections that are usually localized to the skin may disseminate, and guidance on the treatment of these infections is limited. Herpes simplex can be severe, and less common presentations such as herpetic sycosis and herpes vegetans have been reported. Severe herpes zoster, including disseminated infection, requires intravenous antiviral treatment. Viral warts can be particularly difficult to treat, and in atypical or treatment-resistant cases a biopsy should be considered. Superficial candidosis occurs very commonly in people living with HIV, and antifungal resistance is an increasing problem in non-albicans Candida species. Systemic infections carry a poor prognosis. In tropical settings the endemic mycoses including histoplasmosis are a problem for people living with HIV, and opportunistic infections can affect those with advanced HIV in all parts of the world. Most cutaneous infections can develop or worsen as a result of immune reconstitution in the weeks to months after starting antiretroviral therapy. Direct microscopic examination of clinical material can facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment initiation, although culture is important to provide microbiological confirmation and guide treatment.",

Prognosis varies, and treatment involves an assessment of the severity of disease to determine whether to initiate topical or systemic immunosuppressive agents. We present an atypical presentation of BP that presented as a 3-to-4-week duration of pruritic small vesicular lesions in the upper chest, scabbed circular lesions along the upper extremity and pinnas of bilateral ear. Initially thought to be herpes zoster infection initially treated with valacyclovir for a week following a prior concern of a concomitant superficial skin infection with cephalexin and prednisone. With no clinical improvement, tissue biopsy was performed that confirmed bullous pemphigoid and treatment with steroid taper, doxycycline, and triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream was started.

The development of JAK inhibitors has expanded treatment choices in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a sustained class-effect efficacy. Filgotinib is a novel selective inhibitor of JAK1 isoform licensed for use in RA and ulcerative colitis. In this review we aim to present an analysis of filgotinib's efficacy and drug-specific safety warnings. Patients with RA with or without concomitant conventional synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) (naïve or experienced) and those who have failed biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (bDMARDs) were examined in randomised clinical trials. Filgotinib was also tested against placebo, methotrexate, or adalimumab. Long-term extension trials provide insights for up to four years of continuous filgotinib administration. Beneficial effects are depicted in both disease activity parameters and quality of life indexes in moderate or severe RA with a longitudinal efficacy. In head-to-head comparison with adalimumab, filgotinib 200 mg was non-inferior. Adverse effects alerts are marked by the elevated risk of infectious adverse effects with the exception of herpes zoster infection, which has a low incidence.",

        "title": "Biologics Versus JAK Inhibitors. Part II: Risk of Infections. A Narrative Review",
        "abstract": "Introduction:The risk of infections associated with biological drugs (BD) and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) has been extensively explored in the literature. However, there is a dearth of studies that evaluate both pharmacological groups together and, furthermore, compare them. Here, we review the risk of infections associated with BD and JAKi used in dermatology. Methods:A narrative review was performed. All relevant articles evaluating the risk of infection and opportunistic infections with BD and JAKi between January 2010 and February 2024 were selected. Results:Overall, the incidence of infections, serious infections, and opportunistic infections associated with BD and JAKi is low, but higher than in the general population. JAKi approved for dermatological disorders (abrocitinib, baricitinib, deucravacitinib, upadacitinib, ritlecitinib, and topical ruxolitinib) have been shown to be safe, and present a low rate of infections. We found an elevated risk, especially with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents, rituximab, and JAKi (particularly tofacitinib at high doses). Specific associations with infections include tuberculosis and tuberculosis reactivation with anti-TNF agents and tocilizumab; candidiasis with anti-interleukin (IL) 17 agents; hepatitis B virus reactivation with rituximab, anti-TNF, and JAKi; and herpes simplex and herpes zoster infections with JAKi (especially tofacitinib and upadacitinib at high doses). The incidence of infections with ustekinumab and anti-IL-23 was very low. Anti-IL-1, nemolizumab, tralokinumab, and omalizumab were not associated with an increased risk of infections. Dupilumab could decrease the incidence of cutaneous infections. Conclusions:Anti-TNF agents, rituximab, and JAKi (particularly tofacitinib) can increase the risk of infections. Close monitoring of patients undergoing these therapies is recommended. Prospective studies with long-term follow-up are needed to comparatively evaluate the risks of infection deriving from treatment with BD and JAKi.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Polycythemia Vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm hallmarked by deregulated proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells leading to prevalent expansion of red cell mass, increased rate of vascular events, splenomegaly, disease-associated symptoms, and risk of evolution to secondary myelofibrosis and blast phase. PV is pathogenetically associated with autonomously persistent activation of JAK2, which causes overproduction of blood cells and an inflammatory condition responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. Extensively supported by preclinical studies, targeting JAK2-dependent signaling represents a rational therapeutic approach to PV, finally leading to the approval of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor. Areas covered (literature research):We analyzed reports of phase 2 and phase 3 trials with ruxolitinib in PV and relevant literature dealing with efficacy and safety aspects, including most recent real-world reports. Expert opinion:Ruxolitinib is the only JAK2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of PV with well-known efficacy for splenomegaly, symptoms, and potentially reduction of vascular events. The treatment regimen is notably manageable and safe, with the most prevalent side effects primarily encompassing myelosuppression, hyperlipidemia, non-melanoma skin cancer and infections, mainly reactivation of Herpes Zoster. These effects necessitate ongoing surveillance and proactive preventive measures.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with an elevated incidence of infectious diseases and a higher risk of infections-related hospitalization and death. In this study, we delineated the \"vaccinome\" landscape obtained with a large immunization schedule offered by the Regional Government of Lombardy in a cohort of 618,396 patients with diabetes (T1D and T2D). Methods:Between September 2021 and September 2022, immunization coverage for influenza, meningococcus, pneumococcus, and herpes zoster was obtained from the public computerized registry of the healthcare system of Lombardy Region (Italy) in 618,396 patients with diabetes and in 9,534,087 subjects without diabetes. Type of diabetes, age, mortality, and hospitalizations were retrospectively analyzed in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Results:Among patients with diabetes (T1D and T2D), 44.6% received the influenza vaccine, 10.9% the pneumococcal vaccine, 2.5% the anti-meningococcus vaccine and 0.7% the anti-zoster vaccine. Patients with diabetes immunized for influenza, zoster and meningococcus showed a 2-fold overall reduction in mortality risk and a decrease in hospitalizations. A 3-fold lower risk of mortality and a decrease in hospitalizations for both cardiac and pulmonary causes were also observed after influenza, zoster, and meningococcus immunization in older patients with diabetes. Conclusions:Immunization coverage is still far from the recommended targets in patients with diabetes. Despite this, influenza vaccination protected nearly 3,800 per 100,000 patients with diabetes from risk of death. The overall impressive decrease in mortality and hospitalizations observed in vaccinated patients strengthens the need for scaling up the \"vaccinome\" landscape in patients with diabetes.",

Anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the subunit 1 of the type I IFN receptor, has acquired considerable interest and has entered different clinical human trials willing to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Areas covered:This review summarizes the data obtained in phases 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials of anifrolumab for SLE patients. A focus is made on data of clinical efficacy and safety obtained in MUSE, TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials. Expert opinion/commentary:Anifrolumab is a promising therapeutic option for patients with SLE, currently authorized for moderate-to-severe SLE. Extensive real-world use is now going to generate data required to gain experience on the type of patients who benefit the most from the drug, and the exact positioning of anifrolumab in the therapeutic plan.",

        "abstract": "Alopecia areata totalis and universalis are disabling conditions and therapeutically challenging as they are refractory to conventional options. Tofacitinib is a Janus-kinase (JAK) inhibitor utilized to treat alopecia areata (AA) as an off-label drug. In India, FDA-approved JAK inhibitors such as baricitinib and ritlecitinib are not available. There are only a few case reports on tofacitinib in AA in the Indian population. We present the data of 9 pediatric cases of clinically and histologically proven alopecia areata totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU), for whom oral tofacitinib was given after baseline investigations. The following parameters were analysed: Photographic image and severity of alopecia tool (SALT) score at baseline, 3 months and 6 months, and Children Dermatology Life Quality Index (cDLQI) at baseline and 6 months. The mean ± standard deviation (M± SD) of the SALT score and cDLQI(M± SD) at baseline were 95 ± 5 and 17 ± 2. At weeks 4 and weeks 12, the SALT (M± SD) score was 92.7 ± 6.1 and 34.35 ± 11.16, respectively. At weeks 24, the SALT (M± SD) score and cDLQI (M± SD) were 3.33 ± 5 and 6 ± 2. The final reduction in SALT score from the baseline was 100% in 6/9 cases (66.67%), 75% to 99% in 3/9 (22.23%), and 50 to 75% in 1/9 (11.12%). We also observed minimal adverse effects (one child developed herpes zoster) with tofacitinib. Our study demonstrates that oral tofacitinib represents a viable modality in managing difficult-to-treat pediatric AA, such as AT and AU, with a good safety profile.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:This integrated analysis of the phase 2/3 and phase 3 SELECT trials describes the safety profile of upadacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, for up to 5 years of exposure across psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) (including pooled axial spondyloarthritis [axSpA]). Methods:Safety data from five trials of upadacitinib in PsA (2 trials), AS (2 trials), and nr-axSpA (1 trial) were analyzed up to a data cut-off of August 15, 2022. One PsA study included adalimumab as an active comparator. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were summarized for PsA (pooled upadacitinib 15 mg once daily and adalimumab 40 mg biweekly), AS (pooled upadacitinib 15 mg), nr-axSpA (upadacitinib 15 mg), and pooled axSpA (pooled upadacitinib 15 mg from axSpA trials). TEAEs were reported as exposure-adjusted event rates per 100 patient-years (E/100 PY). Results:A total of 1789 patients (PsA, n = 907; AS, n = 596; nr-axSpA, n = 286) received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib 15 mg for 3689 PY of exposure or adalimumab (n = 429) for 1147 PY of exposure. Overall TEAEs and serious TEAEs were highest in PsA and numerically higher with upadacitinib versus adalimumab; rates were similar between AS and nr-axSpA. In PsA, higher rates of serious infection, herpes zoster (HZ), lymphopenia, and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were observed with upadacitinib versus adalimumab. Rates of malignancy excluding NMSC, adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events, and adjudicated venous thromboembolic events were comparable between upadacitinib and adalimumab in PsA and were similar across diseases. Conclusion:Higher rates of serious infection, HZ, lymphopenia, and NMSC were observed with upadacitinib versus adalimumab in PsA; slightly elevated rates for most of these TEAEs were seen with upadacitinib in PsA versus axSpA. Upadacitinib 15 mg demonstrated a generally consistent safety profile across disease states with no new safety signals identified.

Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving patients who presented at the Department of Pain, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University from January 2015 to January 2022. The patients were diagnosed with the first branch of postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia. In total, 63 patients were included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients were divided into the following two groups based on the treatment method used: the nerve block (NB) group (n= 32) and the PRF + NB group (radiofrequency group,n= 31). The visual analog scale (VAS) score, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, and pregabalin dose were compared between the two groups before treatment, 1 week after the procedure, and 1, 3, and 6 months post-procedure, and the complications, such as local infection, local hematoma, and decreased visual acuity, were monitored post-treatment. Results:No significant difference was found in terms of pretreatment age, sex, course of disease, preoperative VAS score, preoperative PSQI score, and preoperative pregabalin dose between the two groups (P> 0.05). The postoperative VAS score, PSQI score, and pregabalin dose were significantly decreased in both groups. Furthermore, significant differences were found between the two groups at each preoperative and postoperative time point (P< 0.05). The VAS score was lower in the radiofrequency group than in the NB group at 1, 3, and 6 months, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). The PSQI score was lower in the radiofrequency group than in the NB group at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months post-procedure, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.05). The dose of pregabalin was lower in the radiofrequency group than in the NB group at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months post-procedure, and the difference was statistically significant at 3 and 6 months (P< 0.05). After 6 months of treatment, the excellent rate of VAS score in the radiofrequency group was 70.96%, and the overall effective rate was 90.32%, which was higher than that in the NB group. The difference in the efficacy was statistically significant (P< 0.05). Conclusion:PRF targeting the supraorbital nerve can effectively control the pain in the first branch of the trigeminal nerve after herpes, enhance sleep quality, and reduce the dose of pregabalin. Thus, this study shows that PRF is safe under ultrasound guidance and is worthy of clinical application.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the potential impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccinations on otologic diseases, including facial nerve paralysis (including Ramsay Hunt syndrome), vestibular neuritis, sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and Meniere's disease. Methods:In this retrospective study, we conducted a time-series analysis employing a causal impact algorithm on a large-scale inpatient database in Japan. We compared the actual number of hospitalized patients with otologic diseases to two predictions: one without any covariates and another with a covariate accounting for the reduction in the number of hospitalized patients due to lockdown measures. Additionally, we performed Granger causality tests to ensure the robustness of our findings. Results:No significant increase was noted in the number of hospitalized patients with otologic diseases following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the causal impact analysis. Similarly, no notable surge was observed in hospitalizations for these diseases following the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Granger causality tests results aligned with the causal impact analysis findings. Conclusion:Our findings indicate that COVID-19 and vaccinations had minimal discernible effects on hospitalization of patients with otologic diseases, suggesting that otologic diseases may not be significantly impacted by COVID-19 and vaccinations, which could have implications for public health policies and the allocation of healthcare resources during a pandemic. Further research and monitoring of long-term effects are warranted to validate these findings and guide healthcare decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Background:Early reports described an increased risk of herpes zoster following receipt of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. The objective was to assess whether COVID-19 vaccine is associated with varicella-zoster virus-induced neurologic disease (VZV-ND). Methods:This multicenter retrospective case-control study with a test-negative design was conducted at 12 hospitals in Israel. We included all patients admitted with VZV-ND between January 2020 and December 2021 and matched controls with a negative polymerase chain reaction result for VZV in cerebrospinal fluid. Results:We identified 188 patients meeting the case definition of VZV-ND who were admitted during the study period. Cases were matched with 376 controls. There was no significant variation in the incidence of VZV-ND between 1 year preceding and 1 year following the deployment of BNT162b2 in Israel. Analysis of persons who had received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (n = 259) showed similar proportions of VZV-ND and non-VZV-ND in 4 intervals (30, 42, 50, 60 days) following the last vaccine dose. The median time from the last vaccine dose to hospitalization with a neurologic syndrome was 53 days (IQR, 25-128) and 82 days (IQR, 36-132) for VZV-ND and non-VZV-ND, respectively, not reaching statistical significance (P= .056). The rate of VZV-ND in vaccinated patients was no different from the rate in the unvaccinated group (30.9% vs 35.4%,P= .2). Conclusions:We did not find an association between COVID-19 vaccine and VZV-ND. Since COVID-19 vaccine is now recommended yearly, every fall and winter, establishing the safety of the vaccine is of great importance.",

        "abstract": "Cervical sympathetic or stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs) have been commonly used in the treatment of painful conditions like complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). However, there is literature to suggest its utility in managing non-painful conditions as well. The focus of this literature review is to provide an overview of indications for SGB for painful and non-painful conditions. We identified published journal articles in the past 25 years from Embase and PubMed databases with the keywords \"cervical sympathetic block, stellate ganglion blocks, cervical sympathetic chain, and cervical sympathetic trunk\". A total of 1556 articles were obtained from a literature search among which 311 articles were reviewed. Among painful conditions, there is a lack of evidence in favor of or against the use of SGB for CRPS despite its common use. SGB can provide postoperative analgesia in selective surgeries and can be effective in temporary pain control of refractory angina and the acute phase of herpes zoster infection. Among non-painful conditions, SGB may have beneficial effects on the management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), refractory ventricular arrhythmias, hot flashes in postmenopausal women, and breast cancer-related lymphedema. Additionally, there have been various case reports illustrating the benefits of SGB in the management of cerebral vasospasm, upper limb erythromelalgia, thalamic and central post-stroke pain, palmar hyperhidrosis, orofacial pain, etc. In our review of literature, we found that SGB can be useful in the management of various non-painful conditions beyond the well-known treatment for CRPS, although further studies are required to prove its efficacy.",

Methods:Data included 765 patients receiving tofacitinib in Phase 2, Phase 3, and long-term extension studies. ALCs/LSCs and incidence rates (patients with events/100 patient-years) of SIEs and HZ were analysed over 75 months. Results:Median ALCs were generally stable over 75 months of treatment. Transient numerical increases from baseline in median LSCs were observed at Month 3; LSCs were generally lower than baseline for Months 36-75. SIE/HZ incidence rates were higher in patients with ALC <0.5 × 103 cells/mm3 versus those with ALC ≥0.5 × 103 cells/mm3 during tofacitinib treatment. Baseline LSCs were similar in patients with/without SIEs or HZ events. Conclusions:SIE/HZ risk was highest in patients with ALC <0.5 × 103 cells/mm3, supporting this threshold as clinically relevant for defining increased SIE/HZ risk in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving tofacitinib. However, SIEs and HZ events did not necessarily occur simultaneously with confirmed lymphopenia, preventing conclusions on possible causal relationships being drawn.",

        "title": "[Henry Head (1861-1940) and his importance for neurology]",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, Henry Head is best known for his Head zones. The concept was understood very differently by Head in comparison to what current medical books falsely describe them to be. In reality, there is no direct relationship between one particular skin zone and one single organ. It is certain that the drawings considered depictions of the Head zones in today's medical textbooks were actually not created by Head. From a neurological point of view, Head is important for two reasons: his self-experiment in 1909 to damage one of his own peripheral nerves followed by regeneration was heroic. It has helped generations of neurologists to have a better understanding of the pathophysiology of peripheral nerve damage and thus make a better assessment of the prognosis of such injuries. Head's second contribution pertains to the radicular organization at the level of the spinal cord. The pathophysiology of herpes zoster radiculitis enabled him to develop the concept of the dermatomes on the basis of preliminary work around 1900. Henry Head's contribution was the systematic compilation of the existing publications of the time and amendment of his own cases. As he was the most important neurologist at that time, at least in the English speaking world, and was well connected with people in the German neurology community, it was probably easy for him to make his dermatome maps well known. In retrospect, Head was less successful in neuropsychology with holistic concepts for higher cognitive functions which were in vogue during his lifetime. His late work on aphasia is now considered refuted. Head's criticism of the strict localization was well in syncronization with the zeitgeist of the early twentieth century. Establishing the fact that Broca's aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia are not easily diagnostically distinguishable from each other was more an achievement of subsequent generations of neurologists and neuropsychologists as well as technical advances. Henry Head ist vielen Neurolog*innen heute vor allem als Namensgeber der Head-Zonen bekannt. Das Konzept, das heute mehr in der Physiologie als in der inneren Medizin bzw. Psychosomatik gelehrt wird, wurde von Head aber höchstwahrscheinlich anders verstanden. Zudem kann als gesichert gelten, dass die Zeichnungen der Head-Zonen nicht von ihm stammen. Aus neurologischer Sicht ist Head heute aus zweierlei Hinsicht wichtig: Sein Selbstexperiment zur Läsion und Regeneration eines peripheren Nervs von 1909 war heroisch. Es hat Generationen von Neurolog*innen geholfen, die Pathophysiologie besser zu verstehen und damit die Prognose peripherer Nervenverletzungen besser einschätzen zu können. Der zweite Beitrag Heads betrifft die radikuläre Organisation auf Rückenmarksebene. Die spezielle Pathophysiologie der Herpes-zoster-Radikulitis erlaubte es ihm, auf der Basis von Vorarbeiten, um 1900 das Konzept des Dermatoms zu entwickeln. Henry Heads Beitrag bestand darin, die Literatur zusammenzutragen und durch eigene Fälle zu ergänzen. Da er zu dieser Zeit der bedeutendste Neurologe zumindest in der englischsprechenden Welt und mit der deutschen Neurologie gut vernetzt war, verbreiteten sich seine Dermatomkarten vermutlich besser als bis dahin bekannte Abbildungen. Weniger erfolgreich war Head aus heutiger Sicht in der Neuropsychologie bzw. mit holistischen Konzepten zu höheren kognitiven Funktionen. Sein Spätwerk zur Aphasie gilt heute als widerlegt. Heads Kritik an der strikten Lokalisation entsprach dabei dem Zeitgeist des beginnenden 20. Jahrhunderts. Dass die klassischen Beispiele Broca- und Wernicke-Aphasie tatsächlich nicht so leicht zu trennen sind, beruhte jedoch mehr auf der Leistung von Generationen von Neurolog*innen und Neuropsycholog*innen folgender Generationen sowie technischen Fortschritten.",

        "title": "Preliminary investigation and analysis of nucleotide site variability of nine glycoproteins on varicella-zoster virus envelope, Jilin Province, China, 2010-March 2024",
        "abstract": "Varicella is endemic worldwide. In China, varicella has not yet been included in the list of legal infectious diseases, nor has a unified national surveillance program been established. And the live attenuated varicella vaccine has not been included in routine immunization. In this study, we analyzed for the first time the varicella epidemiology in Jilin Province in the past 20 years, and the nucleotide site, amino acid site and N-glycosylation site variation of glycoprotein in varicella-zoster virus (VZV) surface 9 in the past 15 years. The results showed that the reported incidence of varicella in Jilin Province in the last 20 years was fluctuating above and below 20/100,000, especially after the epidemic of the COVID-19, and fatal cases appeared in individual years. The genotypic branching of VZV was monitored as Clade 2 in the last 15 years. 9 glycogen nucleotide sites of VZV had different degrees of variability, and the variability had specificity. Therefore, it gives us the idea that in order to reduce the incidence of varicella and herpes zoster, a provincial or even national surveillance program should be introduced as early as possible, and the dynamic monitoring of the variability of the nucleotide sites of VZV should be strengthened at the same time as the vaccine immunization strategy is introduced.",

        "abstract": "Background:Under-utilisation of immunisation services remains a public health challenge. Pharmacists act as facilitators and increasingly as immunisers, yet relatively little robust evidence exists of the impact elicited on patient health outcome and vaccination uptake. Objective:To evaluate the influence of pharmacist interventions on public vaccination rate. Methods:SCOPUS, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched from inception to April 2023 to retrieve non- and randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Studies were excluded if no comparator group to pharmacist involvement was reported. Data extraction, risk of bias assessments, and meta-analyses using random-effect models, were performed. Results:Four RCTs and 15 non-RCTs, encompassing influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, and tetanus-diphtheria and pertussis vaccine types, and administered in diverse settings including community pharmacies, were included. Pooled effect sizes revealed that, as compared to usual care, pharmacists, regardless of their intervention, improved the overall immunisation uptake by up to 51% [RR 1.51 (1.28, 1.77)] while immunisation frequency doubled when pharmacists acted specifically as advocators [RR 2.09 (1.42, 3.07)]. Conclusion:While the evidence for pharmacist immunisers was mixed, their contribution to immunisation programmes boosted public vaccination rate. Pharmacists demonstrated leadership and acquired indispensable advocator roles in the community and hospital settings. Future research could explore the depth of engagement and hence the extent of influence on immunisation uptake.",

Emergency physicians often use erector spinae plane blocks in the emergency department (ED) for rib fractures when acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), and opioids fail to control pain. They have also demonstrated successful pain management for conditions like herpes zoster, renal colic, burns, and acute pancreatitis for ED patients. With low reported rates of complication and relatively easy landmarks to identify, erector spinae plane blocks are an appealing regional anesthetic technique for emergency physicians to utilize for uncontrolled pain. We present the case of a 58-year-old male presenting to the ED with chest pain from pneumonia which remained unmanageable after acetaminophen, NSAID, and opioid administration. An ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block was performed in the ED and the patient had a significant reduction in his chest pain.",

        "abstract": "Adult smokers, those with comorbidities, and the elderly, are at greater risk of contracting infections and their complications. Community acquired respiratory infections due to viruses, pneumococcus and other bacteria, affect both healthy and sick adults. There are vaccines that the pulmonologist must know and prescribe. The target strains of the influenza vaccine are defined by the WHO for the Southern hemisphere considering those involved in the previous influenza season in the Northern hemisphere. Its effectiveness depends on virulence, concordance between circulating and vaccine strains, and population coverage. The anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine available since 1983 is being replaced by more effective conjugate vaccines to prevent infections related to serotypes present in them. Immunization against SARS-CoV-2 reduced the contagion, severity, and lethality of COVID-19. The acellular vaccine against Bordetella pertussis for adults is present for specific situations in the adult calendar; vaccinating them strengthens the control of childhood contagion. The double (diphtheria + tetanus), and triple (double + pertussis) bacterial vaccines, and the vaccines against measles, chickenpox, rubella, human papillomavirus, Haemophilus influenzae, meningococcus, herpes zoster, Argentine hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever, are of a more limited use. Soon we will have new vaccines such as the one recently approved by the FDA against respiratory syncytial virus. Through a consensus of experts in respiratory infections, we review the new evidence regarding the immunization of adults who consult a pulmonologist, and thus update the recommendations on vaccination made eight years ago. Los adultos fumadores con comorbilidades, y los ancianos, corren mayor riesgo de contraer infecciones y sus complicaciones. Las infecciones respiratorias comunitarias por virus, neumococo y otras bacterias afectan tanto a adultos sanos como enfermos. Existen vacunas que el neumonólogo debe conocer y prescribir. Las cepas blanco de la vacuna contra influenza son definidas por la OMS para el hemisferio sur considerando a las implicadas en la temporada precedente de influenza en el hemisferio norte. Su efectividad depende de la virulencia, la concordancia entre las cepas circulantes y las vacunales y la cobertura de la población. La vacuna anti-neumocócica polisacárida disponible desde 1983 está siendo reemplazada por vacunas conjugadas más eficaces para prevenir infecciones relacionadas a serotipos presentes en las mismas. La inmunización contra SARS-CoV-2 redujo el contagio, la gravedad y la letalidad de COVID-19. La vacuna acelular contra Bordetella pertussis para adultos está presente para situaciones puntuales en el calendario para adultos, vacunarlos fortalece el control del contagio infantil. Las vacunas doble bacteriana (difteria + tétanos), y triple (doble + pertussis), y contra sarampión, varicela, rubeola, virus del papiloma humano, Haemophylus influenzae, meningococo, herpes zóster, fiebre hemorrágica argentina y fiebre amarilla, son de uso más limitado. Pronto contaremos con nuevas vacunas, como la recientemente aprobada por la FDA contra el virus sincicial respiratorio. Revisamos a través de un consenso de expertos en infecciones respiratorias las nuevas evidencias acerca de la inmunización de adultos que consultan al neumonólogo, y actualizamos así las recomendaciones sobre vacunación realizadas ocho años atrás.",

        "abstract": "Background:Numerous observational studies have indicated that patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) frequently had infections with various pathogens before the onset of the disease, particularly several viral infections. Some of these infections are linked to specific clinical and immunological subgroups of GBS, suggesting a potential correlation between viral infections and the development of GBS. However, observational studies have several limitations, including the presence of confounding factors. Method:We explored the potential correlation between HIV, SARS-CoV-2, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, and influenza virus with GBS using a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach. The data was derived from published summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). After removing linkage disequilibrium, selecting strong instrumental variables and addressing confounding factors, we would conduct a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis along with sensitivity testing and the MR-Steiger directional test. Result:HIV may have a causal association with GBS (IVW: p = 0.010, OR [95% CI] 1.240 [1.052-1.463]), while no such relationship exists with COVID-19 (IVW: p = 0.275, OR [95% CI] 0.831[0.596-1.159]), varicella (IVW: p = 0.543, OR [95% CI] 0.919 [0.701-1.206]), herpes zoster (IVW: p = 0.563, OR [95% CI] 0.941 [0.766-1.156]), HSV (IVW: p = 0.280, OR [95% CI] 1.244 [0.837-1.851]), EBV (IVW: p = 0.218, OR [95% CI] 0.883 [0.724-1.076]), HBV (IVW: p = 0.179, OR [95% CI] 1.072 [0.969-1.187]), or influenza virus (IVW: p = 0.917, OR [95% CI] 0.971 [0.553-1.703]). We did not find any abnormal SNPs, pleiotropy, or heterogeneity, nor is there any reverse causation. Conclusion:Our study results indicate a causal relationship between HIV and GBS, providing new research directions for the etiology of GBS.",

        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) manifests as persistent chronic pain that emerges after a herpes zoster outbreak and greatly diminishes quality of life. Unfortunately, its treatment efficacy has remained elusive, with many therapeutic efforts yielding less than satisfactory results. The research to discern risk factors predicting the onset, trajectory, and prognosis of PHN has been extensive. However, these risk factors often present as nonspecific and diverse, indicating the need for more reliable, measurable, and objective detection methods. The exploration of potential biological markers, including hematological indices, pathological insights, and supportive tests, is increasing. This review highlights potential biomarkers that are instrumental for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of PHN while also delving deeper into its genesis. Drawing from prior research, aspects such as immune responsiveness, neuronal injury, genetic makeup, cellular metabolism, and pain signal modulation have emerged as prospective biomarkers. The immune spectrum spans various cell subtypes, with an emphasis on T cells, interferons, interleukins, and other related cytokines. Studies on nerve injury are directed toward pain-related proteins and the density and health of epidermal nerve fibers. On the genetic and metabolic fronts, the focus lies in the detection of predisposition genes, atypical protein manifestations, and energy-processing dynamics, with a keen interest in vitamin metabolism. Tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography, and infrared imaging have come to the forefront in the pain signaling domain. This review compiles the evidence, potential clinical implications, and challenges associated with these promising biomarkers, paving the way for innovative strategies for predicting, diagnosing, and addressing PHN.",

        "abstract": "Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), a neurological disorder is characterized by horizontal gaze palsy because of a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus, a neural pathway that is mainly responsible for coordinating the movements of the eye. INO presents with diplopia and impaired adduction of the affected eye, accompanied by abducting eye nystagmus. The condition also arises from different etiologies which include multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, Lyme disease, HIV, and herpes zoster. Artery of Percheron (AOP) infarction is a subtype of bilateral thalamic infarction that poses a unique form of diagnostic perplexity due to its varied and often non-specific clinical manifestations such as altered responsiveness, memory disturbances, and oculomotor deficits. Here we discuss a 53-year-old female who presented with INO in the context of an AOP infarct. Under this context, the clinical finding includes some paradigms like nystagmus, anisocoria, and bilateral ptosis. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an acute infarct in the AOP territory, which supplies the rostral midbrain and paramedian thalami. This case emphasizes the critical importance of meticulous clinical evaluation and the utilization of advanced imaging techniques in diagnosing rare stroke syndromes like AOP infarction. Management of the patient included dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent further thromboembolic events and supportive care to address the immediate neurological deficits. Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial for better patient outcomes. Long-term management focuses on the secondary prevention of stroke through lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, and regular monitoring. Education on uncommon stroke syndromes and continued research are essential for enhancing the accuracy of diagnosis and efficacy of treatment which ultimately leads to better patient care and prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Pain is frequently encountered in dermatology practice, which impairs the activities of daily living, adds to psychological morbidity, and therefore compromises the quality of life. It ranges from mild to severe in intensity across various dermatoses and requires prompt addressal and treatment. Diseases such as extensive pemphigus vulgaris and Stevens-Johnson syndrome are especially painful and require a multidisciplinary approach with the involvement of a pain specialist in their management. The main pathogenic types of pain include visceral nociceptive, somatic nociceptive, and neuropathic types, the latter two being most relevant in dermatological disorders. Somatic nociceptive pain is often seen in patients of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ Toxic epidermal necrolysis, epidermolysis bullosa, pemphigus vulgaris, erythema nodosum, and hidradenitis suppurativa, while neuropathic pain is part of the disease process in dermatoses like leprosy, herpes zoster, and dysesthesia syndromes. Therapeutic approaches to pain management include the use of non-opioids (acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents), opioids, and non-pharmacological therapies, along with appropriate management of the underlying dermatosis. World Health Organisation (WHO) analgesic ladder remains the most commonly employed guideline for the management of pain, although treatment needs individualisation depending on the nature and severity of pain (acute/chronic), type of dermatosis, and patient factors. There is a paucity of literature pertaining to pain management in dermatology and this topic is often neglected due to a lack of awareness and knowledge of the topic. The present review aims to discuss the pain pathway, various painful conditions in the setting of medical dermatology practice, and their management along with relevant pharmacology of the commonly used analgesics.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To compare the risk of infection in inflammatory arthritis patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.Methods:PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to 28 December 2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing TNF inhibitors and reporting infections. Subsequently, pairwise and network meta-analyses were conducted to determine odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:A total of 61 RCTs involving 20,458 patients were included. Pairwise meta-analysis revealed that certolizumab pegol was significantly associated with an increased risk of serious infection compared to placebo (OR:2.28, 95% CI: 1.13-4.62). Both adalimumab and certolizumab pegol were also significantly associated with an increased risk of any infection compared to placebo (OR:1.18, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.30 and OR:1.40, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.76, respectively). Moreover, a network meta-analysis indicated that certolizumab pegol and infliximab were associated with a higher risk of serious infection compared to other TNF inhibitors. In the cumulative ranking of any infection risk, certolizumab pegol had the highest risk compared with others. TNF inhibitors increased the risk of tuberculosis but not that of herpes zoster.Conclusion:Available evidence indicates etanercept and golimumab are likely associated with a lower risk of infection compared to other TNF inhibitors in inflammatory arthritis. For patients at a heightened risk of infection, prioritizing the use of etanercept and golimumab may be advisable to minimize patient risk.Systematic Review Registration:identifier CRD42022316577.",

Neuromodulation such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and trigeminal semilunar ganglion stimulation (TSGS) have become effective methods for treating postherpetic neuralgia. Methods:A retrospective analysis of clinical data from 30 patients with postherpetic neuralgia who underwent SCS or TSGS treatment from January 2022 to January 2024. Patients received conventional treatment before neuromodulation. Clinical data including patient age, gender, pain characteristics, treatment outcomes were collected. The efficacy was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Modified Global Impression of Change scale. Optimal stimulation parameters were also analyzed. Results:The results showed that postoperative pain was significantly reduced in both SCS and TSGS groups, with a higher satisfaction rate in the SCS group (89 % vs. 77 %). The optimal stimulation parameters for the two treatments were also different. Compared to SCS, TSGS required a higher frequency but lower pulse width and voltage. Conclusion:This study suggests that neuromodulation may be an effective treatment for PHN, but the subtle differences between SCS and TSGS support a more personalized treatment approach.",

        "abstract": "We report a case of disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-itis with zosteriform skin eruption, purpura, and livedo racemosa in a 70-year-old critically ill patient who has a history of in situ bladder carcinoma treated with intravesical BCG instillations for the last three years. He presented with fever, fatigue, and a painful lesion on his back, initially diagnosed as herpes zoster. Despite antiviral treatment, he exhibited persistent fever, an inflammatory syndrome, and mild liver enzyme elevation. Initial imaging revealed findings consistent with pneumonia, for which antibiotics were prescribed with no improvement. A subsequent fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scan identified hypermetabolic lesions in the liver, prompting a biopsy that showed non-caseating granulomas. Skin biopsies from the zosteriform papular eruption on the back and purpura with livedo racemosa on the right foot revealed non-caseating granulomas. Specific Wade Fite staining performed on skin biopsies indicated evidence of mycobacterial infection. Additionally, cultures and Ziehl-Nielsen staining of blood and bone marrow confirmedMycobacterium bovisinfection, establishing the diagnosis of disseminated BCG-itis. Treatment with rifampicin, ethambutol, and moxifloxacin, and a later switch to isoniazid, along with corticosteroids, resolved the skin lesions and improved the patient's condition. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges and the importance of considering disseminated BCG-itis in patients treated with prior intravesical BCG instillations for in situ bladder carcinoma presenting with persistent fever, multi-organ involvement, and diverse skin manifestations including zosteriform papules, purpura, and livedo racemosa.",

Methods:Task force members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database search, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Articles written in English or Portuguese on peripheral facial palsy were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians' guideline grading system and the American Thyroid Association's guideline criteria were used for critical appraisal of evidence and recommendations for therapeutic interventions. Results:The topics were divided into 2 main parts: (1) Evaluation and diagnosis of facial palsy: electrophysiologic tests, idiopathic facial palsy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, traumatic peripheral facial palsy, recurrent peripheral facial palsy, facial nerve tumors, and peripheral facial palsy in children; and (2) Rehabilitation procedures: surgical decompression of the facial nerve, facial nerve grafting, surgical treatment of long-term peripheral facial palsy, and non-surgical rehabilitation of the facial nerve. Conclusions:Peripheral facial palsy is a condition of diverse etiology. Treatment should be individualized according to the cause of facial nerve dysfunction, but the literature presents better evidence-based recommendations for systemic corticosteroid therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background:Systemic Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) and dupilumab both have emerged as promising therapeutics for atopic dermatitis (AD). Dupilumab has a favorable safety profile, but oral JAKi therapy has been established in other diseases that carry potential comorbid susceptibilities that influence safety. Objective:We sought to provide real-world evidence of the comparative safety of oral JAKi versus dupilumab in patients with AD. Methods:The study used observational data from multiple healthcare organizations in the US. Patients with AD treated with either oral JAKi (upadacitinib, abrocitinib, and baricitinib) or dupilumab were enrolled. The 2 treatment groups were propensity score matched 1:1 on the basis of demographics, comorbidities, and prior medications. Safety outcomes within 2 years after the initiation of medications were measured by hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results:A total of 14,716 patients were included, with 942 patients treated with oral JAKi and 13,774 with dupilumab. The 2 treatment groups respectively included 938 patients after matching. Treatment with oral JAKi was not associated with increased risks of mortality, malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, renal events, or serious gastrointestinal events. However, patients receiving oral JAKi showed significantly higher risks of skin and subcutaneous tissue infection (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.07-1.69), herpes infection (herpes simplex, HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.03-2.61; herpes zoster, HR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.14-5.52), acne (HR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.54-2.84), cytopenia (anemia, HR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.39-2.41; neutropenia, HR = 4.02, 95% CI = 1.91-8.47; thrombocytopenia, HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.08-2.89), and hyperlipidemia (HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.09-1.92); the risk of ophthalmic complications was higher in those receiving dupilumab (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.03-2.17). Conclusion:Oral JAKi did not exhibit concerning safety issues in treating patients with AD but increased the risk of infections and abnormalities in laboratory findings. Long-term follow-up data are required to validate these results.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Patients with psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are at increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ), but healthcare resource use (HRU) and costs relating to HZ in adults with PsA are unknown. We aimed to estimate the incidence of HZ among adults with PsA vs without psoriatic disease and the additional HRU and costs among patients with PsA with vs without HZ. Patients and methods:This retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study estimated HZ incidence in PsA+ vs PsO-/PsA- cohorts and HRU and medical/pharmacy costs among PsA+/HZ+ vs PsA+/HZ- cohorts comprised of adults from Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database during 2015-2020. For the HRU/cost analyses, index was the date of first HZ diagnosis (PsA+/HZ+ cohort) or was randomly assigned (PsA+/HZ- cohort). Generalized linear models were used for adjusted comparisons between cohorts. Results:HZ incidence was higher in the PsA+ (n = 57,126) vs PsO-/PsA- (n = 23,837,237) cohort (14.85 vs 7.67 per 1000 person-years; adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]: 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.30). Numbers of outpatient visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient admissions were significantly higher in the PsA+/HZ+ (n = 1045) vs PsA+/HZ- (n = 36,091) cohorts during the first month after HZ diagnosis (outpatient: aIRR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.63-1.86; emergency department: 3.14; 95% CI: 2.46-4.02; inpatient: aIRR: 2.61; 95% CI: 1.89-3.61). Mean all-cause per-patient costs were significantly higher in the PsA+/HZ+ vs PsA+/HZ- cohorts during the first month after index ($6493 vs $4521; adjusted cost difference: $2012; 95% CI: $1204-$3007). HRU and costs were numerically higher in the PsA+/HZ+ cohort during the first 3 and 12 months. Conclusion:These findings, which provide evidence on the increased incidence and HRU and economic burden associated with HZ among adults with PsA, could be used to inform clinical practice and decision-making.",

        "abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib and filgotinib, are increasingly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There has been debate about their safety, particularly following the issuance of guidance by regulatory agencies advising caution in their use in certain patients. The registrational clinical trials and registry data of JAK inhibitors did not identify a difference in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), venous thromboembolism, malignancies or infections (other than herpes zoster) with a JAK inhibitor versus a biologic DMARD. In the ORAL Surveillance trial, which enrolled patients >50 years of age with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor, tofacitinib was statistically inferior to TNF inhibitors for the occurrence of MACEs and malignancy. Further post hoc analysis of the data revealed that an age of ≥65 years, a high baseline cardiovascular risk, a history of smoking, sustained inflammation, disease activity and suboptimal treatment of cardiovascular comorbidities all increase the risk of these outcomes. The guidance issued by regulatory agencies should be carefully considered to ensure appropriate and safe treatment of patients with RA without undertreatment of patients who might benefit from JAK inhibitor, as well as biologic, treatment. As always, the risks associated with the use of these agents, treatment goals, costs and patient preferences should be discussed with the patient.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common infection, affecting the majority of the population by age of 50. Recurrent symptomatic outbreaks, experienced by a minority, have significant psychological and psychosexual effects. The varicella zoster virus (VZV), resembling HSV, shows potential for a functional cure via vaccination. This study seeks to investigate if there is an association between low VZV antibody levels and recurrent HSV outbreaks. Methods:A total of 110 patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic HSV were recruited during their sexual health screen. Serum samples were collected between Aug 2019 - July 2022; breaks in the study occurred due to COVID. The primary outcome measure was the serological status of HSV and VZV IgG titre level. Results:The average age was 37.3 years (range 21-65 years). For people with asymptomatic genital HSV2 the average VZV IgG titre was 2373.9 IU/mL (n= 17); and 1219.0 IU/mL for the symptomatic group (n= 67);p≤ 0.00001), with similar results for HSV1. Conclusion:There is a strong association between average higher varicella-zoster virus (VZV) IgG level and being an asymptomatic carrier of herpes simplex sirus (HSV)1&2. A feasibility study to assess the use of the VZV vaccine as a treatment of HSV is planned.",

        "abstract": "In Italy, free vaccinations for Herpes Zoster (HZ), pneumococcal (PCV), and influenza (FLU) are recommended each year for individuals turning 65. Despite this, achieving optimal vaccination coverage remains challenging. This study assesses coverage rates for HZ, PCV, and FLU in Forlì, Northern Italy, and examines how altitude, urban planning, and health organization variables (such as the presence of a vaccination center) impact vaccine uptake. Vaccination coverages were calculated for birth cohorts between 1952 and 1958 for each municipality in the Forlì area as of 1 March 2024. The geographical factors influencing the vaccination uptake were extracted from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) records and evaluated through a multivariate analysis. The sample analyzed included 15,272 vaccine campaign targets from Forlì's province (185,525 citizens); the vaccine uptake rates for HZ, PCV, and FLU were 26.9%, 36.7%, and 43.5%, respectively. Gender did not appear to influence vaccine uptake. Living in a flat area appeared to increase vaccine uptake in a statistically significant way for all the vaccinations when compared to a mountainous area (HZ: OR: 1.50, PCV: OR: 1.33, FLU: OR: 1.67). The presence of a vaccine service in low-urbanized areas was shown to increase vaccine uptake for all vaccinations (HZ: OR: 1.65, PCV: OR: 1.93, FLU: OR: 1.53) compared with low-urbanized areas without a vaccination center or more urbanized areas with a vaccination center. This study emphasizes the significance of the territorial context, along with the ease of access to vaccinations and geographic barriers, as key determinants in achieving vaccination targets. Local health authorities should consider these factors when implementing vaccination campaigns.",

        "abstract": "Background:The genetic susceptibility association between viral infection and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been established. Methods:We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. In addition to traditional MR methods, we employed several other approaches, including cML, ConMix, MR-RAPS, and dIVW, to comprehensively assess causal effects. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to ensure the robustness of the results. Results:After sensitivity analysis, presence of SNPs linked to increased susceptibility to cold sores infection was found to decrease the risk of CRC (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.93, P = 0.01). In subgroup analysis, presence of SNPs linked to increased susceptibility to viral hepatitis (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.98, P = 0.02) and infectious mononucleosis (OR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.98, P = 0.02) were associated with a decreased risk of colon cancer, while measles virus (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.07-1.85, P = 0.01) was associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. Presence of SNPs linked to increased susceptibility to herpes zoster (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05-1.52, P = 0.01) was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer, while infectious mononucleosis (OR: 0.809, 95% CI: 0.80-0.98, P = 0.02) was associated with a decreased risk. Conclusion:The study provides the first evidence of the genetic susceptibility associations between different viral infections and CRC, enhancing our understanding of the etiology of CRC.",

        "abstract": "More frequent among adults, phenocopies may be caused by somatic mutations or anti-cytokine autoantibodies, mimicking the phenotypes of primary immunodeficiencies. A fourteen-year-old girl was referred for a two-year history of weight loss and multiple recurrent abscesses, complicated recurrent pneumonia, pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, and septic shock, without fever. She had started with nausea, hyporexia, and weight loss, then with abscesses in her hands, knee, ankle, and spleen. She also developed a rib fracture and left thoracic herpes zoster. The patient was cachectic, with normal vital signs, bilateral crackles on chest auscultation, tumefaction of the knee joint, and poorly healed wounds in hands and chest, oozing a yellowish fluid. Chest computed tomography revealed multiple bilateral bronchiectases. Laboratory workup reported chronic anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, mild lymphopenia, thrombocytosis, pan-hypergammaglobulinemia, and elevated acute serum reactants. Lymphocyte subsets were low but present. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected via polymerase chain reaction in a bone biopsy specimen from ankle osteomyelitis. Whole-exome sequencing failed to identify a monogenic defect. Interleukin-12 was found markedly elevated in the serum of the patient. Phosphorylation of STAT4, induced by increasing doses of IL-12, was neutralized by patient serum, confirming the presence of anti-IL12 autoantibodies. IL-12 and IL-23 are crucial cytokines in the defense against intracellular microorganisms, the induction of interferon-gamma production by lymphocytes, and other inflammatory functions. Patients who develop neutralizing serum autoantibodies against IL12 manifest late in life with weight loss, multiple recurrent abscesses, poor wound healing, and fistulae. Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies was effective.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To evaluate the clinical outcomes of intravenous tocilizumab (TCZ) injection in patients with moderate-to-severe active thyroid eye disease (TED). Methods:Patients with active and moderate-to-severe TED who did not respond to conventional therapies were treated with TCZ from June 2019 to January 2021. The medical records of the patients were evaluated before the treatment. We analyzed patient demographics, including the duration of Graves' disease and TED, and assessed subjective symptoms, such as diplopia and ocular movement, clinical activity score (CAS), modified NOSPECS score, and exophthalmos before treatment and at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after the first drug injection. Blood tests, including TSH Rc Ab and TS Ab, were performed before treatment and 24 weeks after the first injection. And orbital computed tomography (CT) was performed and Barrett's Index was calculated at baseline and after completion of all injections. Results:Nineteen completed the scheduled treatment. There were no significant side effects, other than herpes zoster in one case and headache and dermatitis in another. Clinical symptoms before and 16 weeks after the treatment showed mean CAS decreased by 2.4 points, mean modified NOSPECS score decreased by 3.7 points, and mean exophthalmos decreased by 0.4 mm. Diplopia and extraocular muscle limitation improved in ten and remained stationary in five of the 15 patients, who presented with extraocular motility abnormalities. Six of 11 patients who underwent orbit CT showed improvement in muscle size. The mean TSH Rc Ab decreased by 7.5 IU/L and TS-Ab decreased by 162.9%. Conclusion:TCZ can treat active moderate-to-severe TED, showing high drug compliance and reasonable response to inflammation and extraocular motility abnormality.",

        "abstract": "Rationale:Primary myelofibrosis is a subtype of myeloproliferative neoplasm that leads to bone marrow fibrosis. Historically, the only curative option for primary myelofibrosis was allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, is now used for the treatment of primary myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. It effectively improves symptoms related to splenomegaly and anemia. However, its association with the development of opportunistic infections has been observed in clinical studies and practical application. Patient concerns:A 64-year-old female with primary myelofibrosis and chronic hepatitis B infection who received ruxolitinib treatment. She was admitted for spiking fever and altered consciousness. Diagnosis:Tuberculosis meningitis was suspected but cerebrospinal fluid can't identify any pathogens. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a left psoas abscess and an enlarged spleen. A computed tomography-guided pus drainage procedure was performed, showing a strong positive acid-fast stain and a positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction result. Interventions:antituberculosis medications were administered. The patient developed a psoas muscle abscess caused by tuberculosis and multiple dermatomes of herpes zoster during antituberculosis treatment. Outcomes:The patient was ultimately discharged after 6 weeks of treatment without apparent neurological sequelae. Lessons:This case underscores the importance of clinicians evaluating latent infections and ensuring full vaccination prior to initiating ruxolitinib-related treatment for primary myelofibrosis.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:This study sought to compare the long-term outcomes of surgeries for retinal detachment (RD) secondary to viral or parasitic infectious retinitis. Methods:A total of 47 eyes that received pars plana vitrectomy with or without scleral buckling due to RD secondary to polymerase chain reaction-proven viral (cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, and herpes zoster virus) or parasitic (toxoplasma and toxocara) retinitis from October 1, 2006, to June 30, 2023, in a single medical center were retrospectively enrolled. Results:Mean follow-up period was 59.03 ± 55.24 months in viral retinitis and 34.80 ± 33.78 months in parasitic retinitis after primary reattachment surgery. During follow-up, nine eyes (24.3%) with viral retinitis and five eyes (50.0%) with parasitic retinitis developed retinal redetachment. Visual acuity success at final follow-up was achieved in 19 eyes (51.4%) with viral retinitis and six eyes (60.0%) with parasitic retinitis (p = 0.64). The incidence of retinal redetachment during the 1st postoperative year was significantly higher in parasitic retinitis compared with viral retinitis (crude incidence, 0.21 vs. 0.85; p = 0.02). Hazard ratio analysis adjusted for age and sex showed 4.58-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.22-17.27; p = 0.03) increased risk of retinal redetachment in parasitic retinitis compared with viral retinitis during the 1st postoperative year. Tamponade with silicone oil and preoperative diagnostic vitrectomy were associated with significantly decreased risk of retinal redetachment in patients with parasitic retinitis. Conclusions:Compared with RD secondary to viral retinitis, RD secondary to parasitic retinitis showed higher incidence of retinal redetachment during the 1st postoperative year. Tamponade with silicone oil and preoperative diagnostic vitrectomy were associated with significantly decreased risk of retinal redetachment in patients with parasitic retinitis.",

        "abstract": "Background:The cost effectiveness of childhood varicella vaccination is uncertain, as evidenced by variation in national health policies. Within the European Economic Area (EEA), only 10 of 30 countries offer universally funded childhood varicella vaccination. This study estimates the cost effectiveness of universal childhood varicella vaccination for one EEA country (Ireland), highlighting the difference in cost effectiveness between alternative vaccination strategies. Methods:An age-structured dynamic transmission model, simulating varicella zoster virus transmission, was developed to analyse the impact of three vaccination strategies; one-dose at 12 months old, two-dose at 12 and 15 months old (short-interval), and two-dose at 12 months and five years old (long-interval). The analysis adopted an 80-year time horizon and considered payer and societal perspectives. Clinical effectiveness was based on cases of varicella and subsequently herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia avoided, and outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were presented in 2022 Irish Euro and cost effectiveness was interpreted with reference to a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY gained. Results:From the payer perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a one-dose strategy, compared with no vaccination, was estimated at €8,712 per QALY gained. The ICER for the next least expensive strategy, two-dose long-interval, compared with one-dose, was estimated at €45,090 per QALY gained. From a societal perspective, all three strategies were cost-saving compared with no vaccination; the two-dose short-interval strategy dominated, yielding the largest cost savings and health benefits. Results were stable across a range of sensitivity and scenario analyses. Conclusion:A one-dose strategy was highly cost effective from the payer perspective, driven by a reduction in hospitalisations. Two-dose strategies were cost saving from the societal perspective. These results should be considered alongside other factors such as acceptability of a new vaccine within the overall childhood immunisation schedule, programme objectives and budget impact.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:The evolution of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has improved patient prognosis. However, more real-world safety/effectiveness data comparing methotrexate (MTX), tofacitinib, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), and non-TNFi biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) are warranted. Methods:The CorEvitas RA Japan registry was used to identify patients with rheumatologist-diagnosed RA who initiated MTX/tofacitinib/TNFi/non-TNFi bDMARDs. Safety outcomes included incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), total cardiovascular disease, total serious infections, total herpes zoster, and total malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). Effectiveness outcomes included change from baseline (Δ) in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and proportion of patients achieving a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in CDAI at month 6. Adjusted regression models were fit; marginal means were estimated. Results:Overall, 1972 patients were included in the safety cohort: MTX (N = 298); tofacitinib (N = 253); TNFi (N = 663); non-TNFi (N = 758). Mean follow-up time was 3.8, 2.9, 3.0, and 2.9 years for MTX, tofacitinib, TNFi, and non-TNFi, respectively. Adjusted incidence rates (IRs, patients with events/100 patient-years [95% confidence intervals]) for MACE and total cardiovascular disease, respectively, were numerically lower for MTX (0.34 [0, 0.83]; 0.42 [0, 0.92]) and TNFi (0.09 [0, 0.27]; 0.61 [0.15, 1.07]) versus tofacitinib (0.48 [0, 1.20]; 2.30 [0.38, 4.22]) and non-TNFi (0.77 [0.35, 1.19]; 1.28 [0.73, 1.82]). Serious infections were numerically higher for non-TNFi (4.47 [3.38, 5.56]); herpes zoster was higher for tofacitinib (7.41 [4.52, 10.29]), versus other groups. IRs for malignancies were comparable between groups. Mean ΔCDAI and rates of achieving MCID in CDAI at month 6 were generally greater with tofacitinib versus other groups. Conclusion:Some variations in incidence of safety outcomes were observed between treatments, while certain effectiveness outcomes favored tofacitinib. Sample size variation between groups and low number of safety events limited the analysis. Further studies are warranted to investigate observed differences. Clinicaltrials:GOV:NCT05572567.",

        "abstract": "Background:Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies have received increasing attention in the past few years in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Objectives:This study describes the (i) efficacy and safety of rituximab in people living with MS and (ii) assesses clinical and imaging outcomes following rituximab in MS. Method:This is a chart review from the MS registry maintained at the institute from a University Hospital in South India. Result:Eighty-three (M:F, 26:57) people living with MS received rituximab as immunomodulation between 2007 and 2022 with a median follow-up duration of 18 months. Fifty-nine (71%) were classified as relapsing-remitting MS, 16 (19%) were secondary progressive MS, and 8 (10%) were primary progressive MS. Seventy-two (87%) MS patients did not experience any relapse after receiving rituximab. In relapsing-remitting MS patients, the mean annualized recurrence rate dropped from 1.24 ± 1.19 to 0.16 ± 0.37. Infusion-related reaction occurred in 5 (6% of adverse events), urinary infections in 7 (8.4%), systemic infections in 3 (3%), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia occurred in 1 (1%), and herpes zoster infection in 1 (1%) patient. Mortality was observed in 3 (3.5%) patients. While being on rituximab, 18 (22%) patients had mild COVID-19 illness and they all made complete recovery without any sequalae. Conclusions:Rituximab is a safe, well-tolerated, easily accessible, inexpensive, and effective therapeutic option for people with MS. Rituximab showed both clinical and radiological improvement after a median follow-up of 1.5 years. None of our patients showed any severe COVID infection nor side effects after receiving COVID vaccination.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To investigate the clinical value of adding Jin-gu-lian (JGL) capsules into rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment by examining its impact on disease activity and quality of life (QoL) through a real-world study (RWS). Patients and methods:RWS was conducted to compare the inflammatory markers, including IgM-RF, ESR, and CRP, between RA patients treated with only Western medicine (reference group) and Western medicine plus JGL (study group) during one-year follow-up. The clinical data was acquired from the hospital information system (HIS). Telephone call-based follow-up on QoL (SF-36) and accompanying symptoms, including gastrointestinal complaints, attacks of pneumonia, herpes zoster, URTIs, UTIs, and LTBIs. Finally, the anti-rheumatic drugs given to both groups were also compared. RWS was further validated for its feasibility by performing studies with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment, which is a commonly used anti-rheumatic drug for RA with mild effect. Results:The study group failed to show a significant effect on inflammatory markers, especially on the CRP levels, indicating no additional clinical value of supplementing with JGL. Similarly, at the endpoint, no significant differences between the two groups on QoL and related symptoms were observed. Our study suggests that the patients in the study group might need more anti-rheumatic drugs to fill the treatment insufficiency, and the application ratio of NSAIDs would be significantly higher than the reference group. By conducting this study on HCQ treatment, the positive aspects of controlling disease activity and reducing NSAIDs application were found, which demonstrates the utility of performing the RWS to evaluate the effect of JGL. Conclusion:Adding JGL did not significantly improve the clinical efficacy of RA treatment by this RWS. Folk herbal prescriptions such as JGL are suggested to underwent strict clinical trials before application.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Patients with SLE have an increased risk of comorbidities and impaired survival. We aimed to assess whether various thresholds of oral CS (OCS) can predict development of infections, comorbidities, malignancies and survival in SLE using data from national health registries in Sweden. Methods:All incident SLE cases, age >18 years, in Sweden (n = 5309) between 2005 and 2020 and matched population controls (n = 26 545) were included and followed until 2020, a total of 257 942 patient years. Data from national registers were retrieved including information from the National Prescribed Drug Register. Risk factors were analysed using time-dependent Cox regression models. Results:Compared with no OCS, >0 to <5.0 mg/day, 5.0-7.5 mg/day as well as >7.5 mg/day OCS predicted development of infections (pneumonia, influenza, herpes zoster and urinary tract infection), osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, gastroduodenal ulcers, cataracts, hypertension and mortality (all P < 0.05). OCS >0 to <5.0 mg/day was associated with lower hazard ratios for these comorbidities than higher doses of OCS. Fifteen years after diagnosis, 48% of patients were taking OCS at a median dose of 5.7 mg/day. A small reduction of OCS treatment 5 years after diagnosis in patients diagnosed with SLE 2006-10 compared with 2011-15 was observed, 49% vs 46% respectively (P = 0.039). Conclusion:Results highlight the potential harm associated with even low OCS dose treatment in SLE and the need to judiciously use OCS at the lowest possible dose to maximize efficacy and minimize harm.",

        "abstract": "Upadacitinib, a selective Janus kinase inhibitor, is the first orally administered therapy approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). This work characterized the pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib in CD patients and evaluated the relationships between upadacitinib steady-state plasma exposures and efficacy as well as safety parameters during the 12-week induction and the 52-week maintenance periods, to provide dosing recommendations for the treatment of CD. Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics in CD patients administered the extended-release formulation were consistent with patient populations in other approved indications. None of the evaluated CD-specific patient characteristics (e.g., disease location and prior gastrointestinal surgeries) had a meaningful impact on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Exposure-response analyses during 12-week induction treatment showed that response across all evaluated efficacy end points were approaching a plateau at median plasma exposures associated with 45 mg QD. Analyses for the maintenance period demonstrated that 30 mg QD is predicted to provide an additional 8% to 10% benefit for endoscopic response and endoscopic remission compared with 15 mg QD in patients who failed biologics. The analyses for safety showed a statistically significant relationship between increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures and the percentage of patients experiencing >2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin from Baseline during induction and showed shallow relationships for serious infections and herpes zoster during the maintenance period. These results demonstrated adequate absorption of the extended-release formulation of upadacitinib in CD patients. The exposure-response analyses confirmed that 45 mg QD dose maximized efficacy as induction treatment and supported the selection of 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD as the maintenance doses.",

        "abstract": "Monotherapy with a selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor or intensive granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) has been limited to patients with intractable ulcerative colitis (UC). No previous reports have described the efficacy including histopathological evaluations and the safety of combination therapy with upadacitinib (UPA) plus intensive GMA (two sessions per week) for intractable UC showing resistance to conventional agents and adalimumab. This retrospective study evaluated the 10-week clinical and histopathological efficacy of induction combination therapy with UPA plus intensive GMA in patients with intractable UC. Among eight patients (moderate UC, n = 1; severe UC, n = 7) who received combination therapy with UPA plus intensive GMA, 50.0% had achieved clinical remission by 10 weeks. Percentages of patients with histological-endoscopic mucosal improvement and mucosal healing at 10 weeks were 62.5% and 12.5%, respectively. After excluding one patient who discontinued treatment by week 10 because of intolerance for UPA, mean full Mayo score, endoscopic subscore and C-reactive protein concentration at baseline were 11.43 ± 0.37, 3 ± 0 and 1.29 ± 0.70 mg/dL, respectively. Corresponding values at 10 weeks were 2.28 ± 0.77 (P < 0.03), 1.14 ± 0.34 (P < 0.03) and 0.03 ± 0.008 mg/dL (P < 0.05), respectively. Adverse events of herpes zoster, temporary increase in creatinine phosphokinase and anemia were observed in one patient each. One patient discontinued combination therapy at week 4 because of temporary taste abnormality due to UPA. Combination comprising UPA plus intensive GMA appears likely to achieve satisfactory induction of clinical remission and histopathological improvement for patients with intractable UC for whom conventional agents and anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibody have failed.",

        "abstract": "Syphilis, caused byTreponema pallidumsubsp.pallidum(TPA), is becoming a significant public health concern, with rising incidence in Manitoba exceeding the national average. The province has also seen a demographic shift leading to women representing 51.9% of cases in 2021, leading to the re-emergence of congenital syphilis. Given the similarities in lesion appearance between TPA and other pathogens such as herpesviruses, accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management and prevention. In order to address the potential for missed TPA cases, we conducted a quality assurance study from June 2021 to March 2023, screening over 5,000 mucocutaneous lesion swabs for TPA, initially submitted for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) testing. Positivity rates were 13% for HSV1, 13% for HSV2, 6.7% for VZV, and 6.6% for TPA. Turnaround times (TAT) for TPA testing, as a send-out to the reference laboratory, averaged 17.8 days. Of the TPA-positive specimens, 36% did not have a corresponding TPA PCR test ordered, and 19% did not have accompanying syphilis serology within 30 days of collection. Creation of a multiplex lesion panel identified high sensitivity and specificity for HSV1, HSV2, VZV, and TPA, with robust reproducibility across multiple runs. Incorporation of TPA into a lesion panel improved the TAT to 4 days. Our findings emphasize the need for improved testing strategies to combat the syphilis epidemic and enhance public health outcomes.IMPORTANCESyphilis resurgence has become a significant global public health concern. In particular, the Canadian Prairies have been struggling with high incidence since 2016, exceeding the national Canadian average. We undertook a quality assurance study that highlighted significant gaps in diagnosis of acute syphilis, which led to the development of a highly sensitive and specific multiplex lesion assay for the dual detection of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and syphilis.",

        "abstract": "Small molecules, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1PRMs), are promising new treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Small molecules exhibit more predictable pharmacokinetics than biologics, are less likely to induce immune responses, and can be administered orally. JAK inhibitors function by blocking the activity of JAK enzymes, which prevents the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Tofacitinib and filgotinib are approved for treating ulcerative colitis (UC), while upadacitinib is approved for UC and Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, JAK inhibitors can increase the risk of herpes zoster, cancer, major adverse cardiovascular events, and venous thromboembolism. S1PRMs bind to S1PRs, particularly S1PR1, on lymphocytes. This interaction inhibits lymphocytes from exiting the lymph nodes and migrating to the gut, thereby reducing inflammation and the immune response in the intestinal mucosa. Ozanimod and etrasimod are S1PRMs approved for the treatment of UC, but they can cause side effects such as bradycardia, conduction disorder, and macular edema. Overall, JAK inhibitors and S1PRMs offer significant benefits in managing IBD, although their potential side effects require careful monitoring.",

        "title": "The recombinant shingles vaccine is associated with lower risk of dementia",
        "abstract": "There is emerging evidence that the live herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine might protect against dementia. However, the existing data are limited and refer only to the live vaccine, which is now discontinued in the United States and many other countries in favor of a recombinant vaccine. Whether the recombinant shingles vaccine protects against dementia remains unknown. Here we used a natural experiment opportunity created by the rapid transition from the use of live to the use of recombinant vaccines to compare the risk of dementia between vaccine types. We show that the recombinant vaccine is associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia in the 6 years post-vaccination. Specifically, receiving the recombinant vaccine is associated with a 17% increase in diagnosis-free time, translating into 164 additional days lived without a diagnosis of dementia in those subsequently affected. The recombinant shingles vaccine was also associated with lower risks of dementia than were two other vaccines commonly used in older people: influenza and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccines. The effect was robust across multiple secondary analyses, and was present in both men and women but was greater in women. These findings should stimulate studies investigating the mechanisms underpinning the protection and could facilitate the design of a large-scale randomized control trial to confirm the possible additional benefit of the recombinant shingles vaccine.",

        "abstract": "Ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of Janus kinases, is a standard treatment for intermediate/high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) but is associated with a predisposition to opportunistic infections, especially herpes zoster. However, the incidence and characteristics of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in these patients remain uncertain. In this report, we present the case of a 59-year-old woman with MF who developed disseminated histoplasmosis after seven months of ruxolitinib use. The patient clinically improved after ten weeks of combined amphotericin B and azole therapy, and ruxolitinib was discontinued. Later, the patient received fedratinib, a relatively JAK2-selective inhibitor, without relapse of histoplasmosis. We also reviewed the literature on published cases of proven IFIs in patients with MF who received ruxolitinib. Including ours, we identified 28 such cases, most commonly due toCryptococcusspecies (46%). IFIs were most commonly disseminated (39%), followed by localized lung (21%) infections. Although uncommon, a high index of suspicion for opportunistic IFIs is needed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors. Furthermore, the paucity of data regarding the optimal management of IFIs in patients treated with JAK inhibitors underscore the need for well-designed studies to evaluate the epidemiology, pathobiology, early diagnosis, and multimodal therapy of IFIs in patients with hematological malignancies receiving targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "The number of ageing people with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is increasing. The efficacy of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for RMS declines with age. Also, older persons with MS may be more susceptible to infections, hospitalisations and malignancy. Aging people with MS have higher rates of comorbidities versus aged-matched controls, increasing the individual risk of disability. We review the therapeutic properties of cladribine tablets (CladT) in ageing people with RMS, with regard to their utility for allowing these individuals to cease continuous administration of a DMT (i.e. to act as an \"exit therapy\"). CladT is thought to be an immune reconstitution therapy, in that two short courses of oral treatment 1 year apart provide suppression of MS disease activity in responders that far outlasts the duration of treatment and post-treatment reductions in lymphocyte counts. Post hoc analyses, long-term follow-up of populations with RMS in randomised trials, and real-world evidence suggest that the efficacy of CladT is probably independent of age, although more data in the elderly are still needed. No clear adverse signals for lymphopenia or other adverse safety signals have emerged with increasing age, although immunosenescence in the setting of age-related \"inflammaging\" may predispose elderly patients to a higher risk of infections. Updating vaccination status is recommended, especially against pneumococci and herpes zoster for older patients, to minimise the risk of these infections. CladT may be a useful alternative treatment for ageing people with MS who often bear a burden of multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy and who are more exposed to the adverse effects of continuous immunosuppressive therapy.",

        "abstract": "Background:Various induction regimens are available for kidney transplantation (KT); however, which is superior remains unclear. Moreover, although the induction regimens are effective and important for reducing side effects, their respective relationships with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) after transplantation remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the most effective induction regimen for AMR reduction through network analysis. Methods:We performed a comprehensive search of databases, including basiliximab, alemtuzumab, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and daclizumab as induction regimens for KT from inception to September 1, 2022. Using a network meta-analysis, we investigated the priorities of 5 induction regimens for patient survival, graft failure, and graft rejection after ABO-incompatible KT. Results:In total, 25 studies comprising 1768 people were included in this network meta-analysis. The primary outcome was the AMR rate of other induction regimens compared with that of basiliximab, whereas the secondary outcomes were heart failure, stroke, hospitalization, peripheral artery disease, myocardial infarction, anemia, leukopenia, herpes zoster, or adverse events. Notably, ATG reduced the AMR rate by 59% (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% credible interval, 0.20-0.90), whereas the other drugs did not show statistical significance. Furthermore, secondary outcomes did not significantly differ between the induction regimens. Conclusion:ATG is widely used in KT induction regimens. Our results showed that ATG reduced the risk of AMR in KT recipients when compared with other induction drugs; therefore, it appears to be an efficient choice of induction regimen to reduce AMR after KT.",

Results:Prevalence of immunodepression differed among aetiologies: 15/65 (23%) for VZVE, 13/132 (10%) for HSVE and 30/297 (10%) for other IE (p <0.05), as was presence of seizure at admission: 27/132 (20%) for HSVE, 4/65 (6%) for VZVE and 43/297 (14%) for other IE (p <0.05). Poor outcome at hospital discharge (Glasgow outcome scale ≤3) differed among the three groups: 40/127 (31%) for HSVE, 12/65 (18%) for VZVE and 38/290 (13%) for other IE (p <0.05). Time-to-ACV start was associated with outcome in HSVE (aOR 3.61 [1.25-10.40]), but not in VZVE (aOR 0.84 [0.18-3.85]). Increased ACV dose was not associated with outcome among HSVE (aOR 1.25 [0.44-3.64]) nor VZVE (aOR 1.16 [0.24-5.73]). Discussion:HSVE and VZVE are distinct in clinical presentation, outcome and prognostic factors. The impact of early ACV initiation was more apparent for HSVE than for VZVE; however, this could be because of VZVE's smaller sample size and lower outcome rate leading to low statistical power or because of potential distinct IE pathophysiology.",

        "abstract": "Background:Herpesviruses represent common and significant infectious complications after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). In the last decade, major advances in the prevention and treatment of these infections were accomplished. Objectives:The aim of this paper is to review the recent advances in the prophylaxis and treatment of herpesvirus infections after allogeneic HCT, to assess the persisting challenges, and to offer future directions for the prevention and management of these infections. Sources:We searched PubMed for relevant literature regarding specific herpesviruses complicating allogeneic HCT through March 2024. Content:The largest advances in this past decade were witnessed for cytomegalovirus (CMV) with the advent of letermovir for primary prophylaxis and the development of maribavir as an option for refractory and/or resistant CMV infections in transplant recipients. For varicella zoster virus, prevention of reactivation with the recombinant zoster vaccine offers an additional prophylactic intervention. Pritelivir is being explored for the treatment of drug-resistant or refractory Herpes simplex virus infections. Although rituximab is now an established option for preemptive therapy for Epstein-Barr virus, Human Herpesvirus-6 remains the most elusive virus of the herpesvirus family, with a lack of evidence supporting the benefit of any agent for prophylaxis or for optimal preemptive therapy. Implications:Although considerable advances have been achieved for the treatment and prevention of herpes virus infections, most notably with CMV, the coming years should hold additional opportunities to tame the beast in these herpesviruses postallogeneic HCT, with the advent of new antivirals, cell-mediated immunity testing, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes infusions.",

        "abstract": "Viral infections have been considered as a major cause of morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation in pediatric cohort. Children are at high risk of acquiring virus-related complications due to immunological immaturity and the enhanced alloreactivity risk that led to maintenance of high immunosuppressive regimes. Hence, prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment of such infe ctions are of paramount importance. Among all viral infections, herpes viruses (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus), hepatitis B and C viruses, BK polyomavirus, and respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus and adenovirus) are common in kidney transplant recipients. These viruses can cause systemic disease or allograft dysfunction affecting the clinical outcome. Recent advances in tech nology and antiviral therapy have improved management strategies in screening, monitoring, adoption of prophylactic or preemptive therapy and precise trea tment in the immunocompromised host, with significant impact on the outcome. This review discusses the etiology, screening and monitoring, diagnosis, pre vention, and treatment of common viral infections in pediatric renal transplant recipients.",

        "abstract": "Immunosuppressants are increasingly being used in the clinic to manage immune-related adverse effects. Consequently, the incidence of secondary infections associated with immunosuppression is increasing. However, little is known about primary infections during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment without immunosuppressants. We aimed to evaluate primary infectious diseases during antiprogrammed death ligand-1 immunotherapy without immunosuppressants. We retrospectively screened medical records of 233 patients who underwent ICI treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer between January 2014 and May 2018 at National Cancer Center, Republic of Korea. Subsequently, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of selected patients hospitalized for potential infectious disease without immunosuppressive treatment (n=80). Eight cases (3.4%) were identified as bacterial pneumonia (n=5) and cellulitis, inflamed epidermoid cyst, and wound infection (n=1 each). The bacterial pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were identified in 4 patients with pneumonia. The period between the start of ICI treatment and infection varied between 3 and 189 days (median, 24.5 days). Five (62.5%) patients were infected within a month after ICI treatment initiation. All patients were treated with empirical antibiotics and discharged without complications. The median progression-free and overall survival for ICI treatment was 11.5 and 25.5 months, respectively. Six patients experienced ICI-associated adverse effects postinfection: Herpes zoster infection (n=4) and pneumonitis (n=2). Infectious disease independent of immunosuppression is a rare, but possible event in patients with lung cancer receiving ICI treatment. Clinical awareness would enable prompt diagnosis of primary infection during immunotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Upadacitinib is an orally administered, selective, Janus kinase inhibitor that is approved for several auto-immune conditions, such as axial spondyloarthritis, an inflammatory rheumatic disease that includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). The approvals of upadacitinib for the treatment of AS and nr-axSpA were based on the safety and efficacy data for upadacitinib 15 mg once-daily compared to placebo from the SELECT-AXIS 1 and SELECT-AXIS 2 studies. Population pharmacokinetic analyses based on data from 244 patients with axSpA showed that the pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib were comparable in subjects with AS and nr-axSpA. Exposure-response relationships were characterized for key efficacy and safety end points using data from 482 patients with axSpA. The exposure-response analyses for efficacy based on Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS)20 and ASAS40 responses at week 14, showed a clear differentiation from placebo with no evidence of increased responses with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures. There were no clear exposure-response trends observed for safety end points that included serious infections, herpes zoster, pneumonia, lymphopenia (grade ≥3), neutropenia (grade ≥3), or a greater than 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin from baseline through week 14. The exposure-response analyses for efficacy and safety presented here supported the favorable benefit-risk profile with the use of upadacitinib 15 mg once-daily for the treatment of axSpA.",

        "abstract": "Objective:Acupuncture, a widely employed traditional therapeutic modality known for its efficacy in pain alleviation and diverse condition management, may inadvertently result in mechanical nerve injury due to its invasive nature. This research aimed to ascertain the incidence of nerve injuries post-acupuncture, identify associated risk factors, and map the distribution of nerve injury sites. Methods:A case-control study nested in the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) 2000-2018 two million cohort was conducted. Patients previously diagnosed with nerve injury, surgery, or degeneration before acupuncture were excluded. Cases were defined as patients receiving acupuncture and seeking medical attention for nerve injury (ICD9-CM code 950-957) within 14 days post-procedure, while control groups comprised patients undergoing acupuncture without subsequent adverse events. Invasive treatments prior to adverse events and adverse events occurring more than 14 days post-acupuncture were excluded. To ensure case-control comparability, factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and medical facility environment were controlled using propensity score matching. Results:The study encompassed 14,507,847 acupuncture treatments administered to 886,753 patients, with 8361 instances of post-acupuncture nerve injury identified, representing an incidence rate of approximately 5.76 per 10,000 procedures. Age emerged as a significant risk factor, with the adjusted odds ratios escalating with age. Several comorbidities including diabetes, hypothyroidism, liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, herpes zoster, hepatitis virus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dementia, and cerebrovascular accidents were associated with an elevated risk of nerve injury post-acupuncture. Conclusion:This study underscores the importance of meticulous patient profiling and cautious therapeutic approach in acupuncture, considering the evident influence of various demographic, systemic, and treatment-related factors on the incidence of nerve injuries.",

To better understand factors affecting vaccination rates, we analyzed trends in adult vaccination coverage using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and conducted a targeted literature review (TLR) on interventions to improve adult vaccination rates in the US. Both the BRFSS analysis and the TLR focused on influenza; pneumococcal disease; tetanus and diphtheria or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis; herpes zoster; and human papillomavirus vaccination for US adults aged 18-64 years. The TLR additionally included hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination. Vaccination coverage rates (VCRs) and changes in VCRs were calculated using the 2011-2019 BRFSS survey data. For the TLR, the MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process databases were searched for articles on vaccination interventions published between January 2015 and June 2021. The BRFSS analysis showed that changes in VCRs were generally modest and positive for most states over the study period. The TLR included 32 articles that met the eligibility criteria; intervention strategies that improved adult vaccination outcomes incorporated an educational component, vaccination reminders or reinforcement at the point of care, or authorized non-clinician members of the healthcare team to vaccinate. Furthermore, interventions combining more than one approach appeared to enhance effectiveness. The strategies identified in this TLR will be valuable for policymakers and stakeholders to inform the development and implementation of evidence-based policies and practices to improve adult vaccination coverage.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To evaluate the clinical results of cryopreserved amniotic membrane transplantation as a treatment option for refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers. Methods:This prospective study included 11 eyes of 11 patients who underwent amniotic membrane transplantation for the treatment of refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers at Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná, in the city of Curitiba, from May 2015 to July 2021. Patients underwent different surgical techniques in which the amniotic membrane was applied with the epithelium facing upward to promote corneal re-epithelialization. Results:The median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 34-82 years), and 64% were men. The predominant etiology of corneal ulcers was herpes zoster (45% of cases). Approximately one-third of the patients (27%) were chronically using hypotensive eye drops, and more than half (54%) had previously undergone penetrating corneal transplantation. At the time of amniotic membrane transplantation, 18% of the eyes had corneal melting, 9% had corneal perforation, and the others had corneal ulceration without other associated complications (73%). The time between clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment ranged from 9 days to 2 years. The corrected visual acuity was worse than 20/400 in 90% of the patients preoperatively, with improvement in 36% after 3 months of the procedure, worsening in 18% and remaining stable in 36%. Of the patients, 81% complained of preoperative pain, and 66% of them reported total symptom relief after the surgical procedure. In one month, 54.6% of the patients presented a closure of epithelial defect, and half of the total group evolved with corneal thinning. The failure rate was 45.5% of the cases. Conclusion:Cryopreserved amniotic membrane transplantation can be considered a good alternative for treating refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers, as it resulted in significant improvement in pain (66%) and complete epithelial closure (60%) in many patients at 1 month postoperatively. Notably, the high failure rate highlights the need for further studies to identify patientand ulcer-related factors that may influence the outcomes of this procedure.",

        "abstract": "Evolving evidence suggests that Janus Kinase Inhibitors (JAKi) may predispose to certain infections, including tuberculosis and human herpes viruses. This review aimed to compare the infection risk in patients on a systemic JAKi for a dermatologic indication to a placebo. A systematic review was carried out from inception to June 2023, using the EMBASE, Medline, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library of Registered Trials databases. Eligible studies included placebo-controlled randomized trials that investigated the incidence of infection in patients with a dermatologic indication. Primary outcomes included the most commonly reported infections pertaining to serious and opportunistic infections, upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, herpes simplex, varicella zoster, tuberculosis, neutropenia, and lymphopenia. A meta-analysis of incidence ratios was conducted to determine odds ratios (OR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) analysis. The meta-analysis found no increased risk of serious (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.61-1.43, P = 0.74) or opportunistic infections (OR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.32-1.31, P = 0.23). The incidence of varicella-zoster infections was significantly higher in the JAKi cohort (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.08-2.72, P = 0.022). From 25 studies, there was no overall increased risk of herpes simplex infections (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 0.93-2.23, P = 0.102) to placebo; however, a significantly higher risk in those with atopic dermatitis to alopecia areata was demonstrated (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.13-2.69, P = 0.013). The results of this analysis do not suggest an increased risk of serious and opportunistic infections in those on JAKi compared to placebo. However, they support an increased risk of varicella-zoster infections and a higher risk of herpes simplex infections in those with atopic dermatitis to alopecia areata. The results of this report support these agents' short-term safety but signal that vigilance should be practiced in patients at risk for serious or recurrent herpes virus infections.",

        "abstract": "Background:Evidence from previous observational studies suggest that infection by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) increase the risk of dementia. Objective:To investigate if older adults exposed to HSV treatment have lower risk of dementia than the rest of the population. Methods:We used the 10% Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) database from 2013 to 2022 to ascertain the cross-sectional, time-series and longitudinal association between exposure to HSV treatment and the dispensing of antidementia medicines. Participants were men and women aged 60 years or older. We used Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes to identify medicines dispensed for the treatment of HSV and dementia. Results:During the year 2022 6,868 (1.2%) of 559,561 of participants aged 60 years or over were dispensed antidementia agent. The odds ratio (OR) of being dispensed an antidementia agent among individuals dispensed treatment for HSV was 0.73 (99% CI = 0.56-0.95). Multilevel logistic regression for the 2013-2022 period for those dispensed HSV treatment was 0.87 (99% CI = 0.75-1.00). Split-time span series from 2013 was associated with hazard ratio of 0.98 (99% CI = 0.89-1.07) for individuals dispensed relative to those not dispensed HSV treatment. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and the dispensing of medicines for the treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. Conclusions:The dispensing of antiviral medicines for the treatment of HSV and VZV is consistently, but not conclusively, associated with decreased dispensing of antidementia medicines. This suggests that treatment of HSV and VZV infections may contribute to reduce the risk of dementia.",

This dormant virus, once activated, may affect any ganglia or nerves of the body but most commonly involves the thoracic, cervical and trigeminal nerves in decreasing order of frequency. We review three such cases in which manipulation of the trigeminal ganglion resulted in reactivation of varicella at homologous operative sites. Each patient underwent surgeries in which the trigeminal ganglion was manipulated for the resection of trigeminal schwannoma under a microscope through various approaches. All three patients developed reactivation of varicella at homologous operative sites. A thorough history of chickenpox infection should be taken in patients who are undergoing surgeries for trigeminal pathology. Early diagnosis should be made once any vesicular lesions are seen with prompt treatment. Reassurance and counselling are necessary in these patients. If possible, prophylaxis may be started in all such patients. Further studies are warranted to determine the exact cause of reactivation.",

        "abstract": "Background and objectives:Teriflunomide is a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for multiple sclerosis (MS). This post authorisation safety study assessed risks of adverse events of special interest (AESI) associated with teriflunomide use. Methods:Secondary use of individual data from the Danish MS Registry (DMSR), the French National Health Data System (SNDS), the Belgian national database of health care claims (AIM-IMA) and the Belgian Treatments in MS Registry (Beltrims). We included patients treated with a DMT at the date of teriflunomide reimbursement or initiating another DMT. Adjusted hazard rates (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals were derived from Cox models with time-dependent exposure comparing teriflunomide treatment with another DMT. Results:Of 81 620 patients (72% women) included in the cohort, 22 324 (27%) were treated with teriflunomide. After a median follow-up of 4 years, teriflunomide use compared to other DMT was not associated with a risk of all-cause mortality, severe infection, pneumoniae, herpes zoster reactivation, pancreatitis, cardiovascular condition and cancers. For opportunistic infections, aHR for teriflunomide versus other DMT was 2.4 (1.2-4.8) in SNDS, which was not bound to a particular opportunistic agent. The aHR was 2.0 (1.1-3.7) for renal failures in the SNDS, but no association was found in other data sources. A total of 187 SNDS patients had a history of renal failure prior to cohort entry. None of these patients (0%) had a renal failure recurrence when treated with teriflunomide for 19 (13%) recurrences reported for patients on another DMT. Discussion:We found no evidence that teriflunomide use would be associated with an increased risk of AESI. Trial Registration EUPAS register: EU PAS 19610.",

        "abstract": "Magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) gene loss-of-function variants lead to X-linked MAGT1 deficiency with increased susceptibility to EBV infection and N-glycosylation defect (XMEN), a condition with a variety of clinical and immunological effects. In addition, MAGT1 deficiency has been classified as a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) due to its unique role in glycosylation of multiple substrates including NKG2D, necessary for viral protection. Due to the predisposition for EBV, this etiology has been linked with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), however only limited literature exists. Here we present a complex case with HLH and EBV-driven classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) as the presenting manifestation of underlying immune defect. However, the patient's underlying immunodeficiency was not identified until his second recurrence of Hodgkin disease, recurrent episodes of Herpes Zoster, and after he had undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. This rare presentation of HLH and recurrent lymphomas without some of the classical immune deficiency manifestations of MAGT1 deficiency led us to review the literature for similar presentations and to report the evolving spectrum of disease in published literature. Our systematic review showcased that MAGT1 predisposes to multiple viruses (including EBV) and adds risk of viral-driven neoplasia. The roles of MAGT1 in the immune system and glycosylation were highlighted through the multiple organ dysfunction showcased by the previously validated Immune Deficiency and Dysregulation Activity (IDDA2.1) score and CDG-specific Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS) score for the patient cohort in the systematic review.",

        "abstract": "Background:Viral infections remain a significant problem for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who undergo stem cell transplants (SCTs). These infections often result from the reactivation of latent viruses. However, our understanding of the risk of viral reactivation in CML patients who have not undergone SCT is limited, and there is a scarcity of data on this topic. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of CML as it is highly successful and has transformed the prognosis of patients with CML. However, TKI may be associated with an increased risk of infections. Summary:We have performed a literature search for publications related to viral infections and their reactivations in patients with CML using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for the period 2001-2022. The population consisted of patients over 18 years old with a diagnosis of CML and no history of bone marrow transplantation. In an analysis of 41 patients, with 25 males and 16 females, M:F ratio of 1.56:1, and a median age of 50. Age ranged from 22 to 79 years. Most patients with reported viral infections or reactivations were in the chronic phase (CP) of CML, with 22 patients (76%) in the CP, 6 patients (21%) in the accelerated phase, and 1 patient (3%) in the blast phase. Most cases with reported outcomes responded to treatment for CML; only one had refractory disease and 8 cases (32%) had major molecular response. Imatinib was the most used TKI in 31 patients (77%). The most reported viral reactivations were herpes zoster in 17 cases (41%), followed by hepatitis B reactivation in 15 cases (37%). Key messages:This review sheds light on the importance of having a hepatitis B serology checked before starting TKI therapy and close monitoring for viral infections and reactivations in patients with CML.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the status and influencing factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A questionnaire on COVID-19 vaccination in patients with COPD was developed. The clinical characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination status, other relevant vaccinations, and vaccination status of the patients with COPD were collected anonymously. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination in patients with COPD. There were 1898 returned questionnaires, of which 1874 were valid. The proportion of patients who completed the COVID-19 vaccination program was 78.60%. Factors influencing the COVID-19 vaccination rate were: the age of individuals who were 75-85 years old and > 85 years old, acute exacerbation 3-4 times in the previous year, comorbid cardiovascular and endocrine system diseases, failure to take regular medication for COPD, application of non-invasive ventilation machines, believing that their current health condition has deteriorated, believing that the current COVID-19 vaccine is not safe, medical staff not specifying whether they would recommend vaccination against COVID-19, medical staff not recommending the COVID-19 vaccine, and fear of adverse reactions and aggravation of COPD. Patients with COPD had a high COVID-19 vaccination rate in China, whereas patients with pneumonia, influenza, and herpes zoster had a low vaccination rate. Improving the patients' understanding of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and promoting effective communication between medical staff and patients would help increase the vaccination rate of patients with COPD.",

        "abstract": "Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is one of the most common and serious complications of herpes zoster infection. Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy has emerged to be a neuromodulation technique for the treatment of PHN. Two therapeutic options are available for PRF, including high-voltage and standard-voltage PRF. Some studies suggested that the former one had better clinical efficacy than the latter one. For the first time, this pooled analysis compared the efficacy and safety of these two surgeries for the treatment of PHN. Five commonly used databases were applied to identify the eligible studies. This study was registered on the PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023460236), which provided more relevant information. Finally, four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 285 participants were included. The combined odds ratios (OR) showed that high-voltage PRF exhibited a significantly higher treatment efficiency than the standard PRF (OR = 1.4, 95%CI: 1.16 to 1.69, P < 0.001). Additionally, the visual analogue scale (VAS) in the high-voltage PRF group was significantly lower than that of the standard PRF group at one week (SMD = -0.776, 95%CI: -1.408 to -0.145, P = 0.016), one month (SMD = -0.544, 95%CI: -0.907 to -0.180, P = 0.003), and three months (SMD = -1.096, 95%CI: -1.504 to -0.687, P < 0.001) after treatment, particularly at the three months after surgery. However, the VAS was comparable between the two groups (SMD = -0.94, 95%CI: -1.985 to 0.104, P = 0.077). Patients who underwent high-voltage PRF did not have a significantly higher incidence of adverse events than those with standard PRF (OR = 1.56, 95%CI: 0.78 to 3.13, P = 0.208). In summary, the current study revealed that high-voltage PRF is superior to standard-voltage PRF in improving analgesic efficacy in patients with PHN. Additionally, it does not increase the incidence of treatment-related adverse effects. Further studies are still warranted to determine the optimal voltage and duration of PRF treatment for patients with PHN.",

        "abstract": "Given the higher susceptibility to infectious disease in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies for inflammatory dermatologic conditions, immunization is important in this population. While live vaccines protect against life-threatening diseases, they can be harmful in immunosuppressed patients given the risk of replication of the attenuated pathogen and adverse reactions. The utilization of live vaccines in immunosuppressed patients depends on multiple factors such as the vaccine and therapy regimen. To provide an overview of evidence-based recommendations for the use of live vaccines in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies for dermatological conditions. A literature search of the PubMed database was performed using keywords live vaccine, live-attenuated vaccine, dermatology, immunosuppressed, and immunocompromised, and specific immunosuppressive therapies: corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, biologics. Relevant articles written in English were included. Using these keywords, 125 articles were reviewed, of which 28 were ultimately selected. Recommendations for live vaccines can be determined on a case-by-case basis. Measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV) vaccines may be safely administered to patients on low-dose immunosuppressive agents while the yellow fever vaccine is typically contraindicated. It may be safe to administer live MMRV boosters to children on immunosuppressive therapies and the live herpes zoster vaccine to patients on biologics. Given poor adherence to immunization guidelines in immunosuppressed patients, dermatologists have a critical role in educating patients and general practitioners regarding live vaccines. By reviewing a patient's vaccination history and following immunization guidelines prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapies, physicians can mitigate morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Tofacitinib is a Janus Kinase inhibitor used for treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC), mainly after the failure of biological therapy. There is a paucity of data on the outcome of tofacitinib in biological-naïve UC patients. The present study was aimed at analyzing the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib in biological-naïve Indian patients with UC. Methods:The present study retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients with biological-naïve moderate-to-severe active UC from six tertiary care centers in India receiving tofacitinib from September 2020 to September 2022. Clinical remission or response assessment was based on partial Mayo score (PMS) calculated at baseline and weeks eight, 16 and 24. Results:Total 47 cases (57.4% male, median age: 32 years) were included. After eight weeks of therapy, 33 (70.2%) achieved clinical remission and eight (17.0%) had a primary failure. The baseline serum albumin at treatment initiation was the only independent predictor of remission at eight weeks (Odds ratio: 11.560, 95% CI: 1.478 - 90.404), but not at 16 weeks. By 24 weeks, 59.6% (28/47) of the patients were in remission and 29.8% (14/47) had stopped tofacitinib either due to failure (27.6%) or adverse events (AEs) (2.1%). Among the 47 patients, 10 (21.2%) cases developed AEs during follow-up, including two tuberculosis (4.2%), one cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis (2.1%) and one herpes zoster (2.1%). Four patients with infection required temporary drug discontinuations. One required permanent discontinuation (mania). Conclusion:Upfront tofacitinib is effective in biologic-naïve Indian patients with moderate-severe UC. Further randomized studies are required to validate the study findings.",

The study focuses on the analysis of adverse reactions related to tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib, and filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis patients, including identifying predictive factors linked to their occurrence. Patients and methods:Observational retrospective study. Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis from a university hospital receiving JAK inhibitor treatment between September 2017 and January 2024 were included. The cumulative incidence of each adverse reaction was calculated using the Naranjo scale. Risk factors for developing adverse reactions were identified through logistic regression analyses. Results:Two hundred twenty-three patients were included, with 28.7% presenting adverse reaction related to JAK inhibitor treatment. The adverse drug reactions with the highest cumulative incidence were infections and gastrointestinal disorders. Infections included: upper respiratory tract (4.5%), cellulitis (3.1%), urinary tract (2.7%), herpes zoster (1.8%). Gastrointestinal disorders comprised: abdominal pain (4.0%), diarrhea (3.6%), nausea and vomiting (3.6%), gastrointestinal perforation (1.3%), diverticulitis (0.9%). Classified at 0.5% were: headache, paresthesias, skin rash, severe neutropenia, insomnia, dyspnea, hypertensive crisis. As risk factors, were identified: the treatment with a non-selective JAK inhibitor (OR adjusted: 4.03; 95% CI: 1.15-14.10; P=.029) and older age (OR adjusted: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00-1.05; P=.036). Conclusions:Infections and gastrointestinal disorders represented the adverse reactions related to JAK inhibitor treatment with the highest cumulative incidence, with risk factors for their occurrence being non-selective JAK inhibitor treatment and older age of the patient.",

        "abstract": "Aim:The aim of this study was to examine two hypotheses: 1) Users of Day Care Center for Elderly (DCCE) would have frail health and multiple age-related care needs, and 2) caregivers would have to deal with some levels of anxiety due to the burden of care, and similar levels of quality of life to the users. Materials and methods:The current cross-sectional study was carried out at a DCCE of the regional unit of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between March-April 2022. The study sample comprised 29 DCCE social care services users and 51 caregivers. A short questionnaire sheet was created to record sociodemographic characteristics and general health-related issues. Additionally, the Anxiety Symptom Scale (Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST)) and the Quality of Life (SF-12) were used to measure anxiety and quality of life of the participants. Comparison analysis was performed to detect differences between the two groups. Results:The most common morbidities for users of DCCE were hypertension (58.6%), hypercholesterolemia (55.2%), rheumatoid arthritis (24.1%), diabetes (24.1%) and heart disease (41.4%). Users of social care services have significantly higher vaccination rates (influenza: 100%, COVID-19: 100%, herpes zoster: 44.8%, and pneumococcus: 86.2%) than their caregivers. About 75% (yes: 24% and sometimes: 51.8%) of the users and 45% of their caregivers (yes: 7.8%, and sometimes: 37.3%) felt lonely at least sometimes. All participants were found to have low mean levels of the SAST score (18.4, SD:4.9) and 18.7% were on the verge of severe symptoms. Users of social care services were found to have low average levels of quality of life (SF-12), with significantly lower physical health (28.2, SD: 6.6) compared to the Mental health subscale (39.6, SD: 9.3) (p <0.001). Conclusions:This study highlighted the main health-issues of DCCE users, and that they have low quality of life. Additionally, we found that caregivers faced a few health-issues, and had higher quality of life and lower SAST levels than the users. Therefore, social and health policy providers should consider our findings and assess the users' and caregivers' needs to provide holistic care, thus improving their quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Infections in patients with systemic vasculitis represent one of the main causes of mortality. Corticosteroid use, immunosuppressive therapy, age, associated organic involvement and dialysis dependence are risk factors of infection. Objectives:To determine the prevalence of severe infection and associated factors in patients diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) and Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN). Methods:retrospective study was conduced in a single rheumatology center (2000-2018). We included patients diagnosed with AAV (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA), Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (PAM) and Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Serious infectious events requiring hospitalisation or prolonged antibiotic/antiviral treatment, recurrent infection of Herpes Zoster Virus or opportunistic infections were evaluated. Sites of infection, isolated microorganisms and mortality related were analyzed. Results:105 patients were analyzed, follow-up time median 18 m, 58.7% were women and median age was 52 years. Types of vasculitis: 41.9% PAM, 16.2% EPGA, 40% GPA, 1.9% PAN. Constitutional, pulmonary, renal and otorhinolaryngology manifestations were the most frequent. Prevalence of infection:34.2%, with a median of 3 months from diagnosis of vasculitis to the infectious event. Low respiratory tract (42.8%), sepsis (31.4%), and urinary tract (14.3%) were the most common sites of infections. Bacterial aetiology was the most prevalent (67.7%). Mortality at the first event was 14.3% and a 72.2% of patients were in the induction phase of treatment. Infectious events were significantly associated with age > 65 years (p = 0.030), presence of lung (p = 0.016) and renal involvement (p = 0.001), BVASv3 > 15, mortality (p = 0.0002). Conclusions:The prevalence of infection was 34.2%. Lower airway infections, septicemia and urinary tract infections were the most prevalent. Infections were associated with renal and pulmonary involvement, age older than 65 years and score BVAS > 15. Severe infections were associated with mortality, especially in elderly patients.",

        "abstract": "Objective:This study aimed to compare the incidence rates (IRs) of infections, including herpes zoster (HZ), in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis) or interleukin-6 inhibitors (IL-6is).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 444 RA patients treated using IL-6is (n= 283) or JAKis (n= 161). After adjusting for clinical characteristic imbalances by propensity score matching (PSM), we compared the IRs of infections including HZ between the JAKi and IL-6i groups.Results:Observational period: 1423.93 patient years (PY); median observational period: 2.51 years. After PSM, incidence rate ratios comparing JAKi with IL-6i were 3.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48-9.04) for serious infections other than HZ indicating that the JAKi-treated group was more likely to develop serious infection than the IL-6i-treated group. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that the use of prednisolone > 5.0 mg/day, coexisting interstitial lung disease (ILD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) were independent risk factors for serious infections. The crude IR for HZ was significantly higher in the JAKi group, but the difference between groups was not significant (IRR: 2.83, 95% CI: 0.87-10.96) in PSM analysis. Unadjusted and PSM analyses performed in our study showed increased IRs of serious infections in patients with RA treated with JAKis compared with those treated with IL-6is.Conclusions:The presence of ILD or DM and the use of prednisolone were found to be independent risk factors for serious infection in RA patients treated using JAKis. Whereas the IRs for HZ after PSM were not significantly different between the JAKi and IL-6i groups.",

        "abstract": "Background:Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of herpes zoster infection and affects patients' quality of life. Acupuncture therapy is regarded as a competitive method of treatment for analgesia. Objective:To summarize evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different acupuncture therapies for treating PHN. Methods:Eight electronic databases were searched from their inception to August 5, 2022, including 4 international electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) and 4 Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Database and Wanfang Database). Methodological quality was assessed by A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2). The Risk of Bias in Systematic Review (ROBIS) tool was used to assess the risk of bias in SRs. Evidence level was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results:Totally, 7 SRs were included, including 128 studies and 9,792 patients. In AMSTAR 2, most of the SRs were of low or critically low levels since they had more than 1 critical deficiency. In ROBIS, 1 SR (14.29%) was rated as high risk, and the other 6 (85.71%) were rated as low risk. In the GRADE system, 9 outcomes (28.13%) were valued as high level, 5 (15.63%) as moderate level, 1 (3.13%) as low, and 17 (53.13%) as very low. In the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy, the group \"moxibustion vs. original medical treatment\" [mean difference (MD)=-1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.80 to -1.08, I2=99%, P<0.00001] was of the highest heterogeneity and the group \"bloodletting vs. original medical treatment\" (MD=-2.80, 95% CI: -3.14 to -2.46, I2=0, P<0.00001) was of the lowest heterogeneity. Six SRs have reported the safety of their studies and no serious events were shown in the treatment and control groups. Conclusions:Acupuncture therapy seems to be effective in treating PHN. Despite the evidence that suggested the advantages of acupuncture therapy in relieving pain and promoting efficacy and safety, the methodological quality was quite low. Further studies should pay more attention to the quality of original studies and evidence for SRs to confirm these findings. (PROSPERO registration No. CRD42022344790).",

Aim:To assess the safety and effectiveness of TOFA in clinical practice. Methods:TOFA-UC is a multicenter, observational study performed among the Sicilian Network for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SN-IBD). All consecutive patients with UC starting TOFA from its introduction in Sicily (July 2021) to July 2022 were included. Results:111 patients were included (mean follow-up: 31.7 ± 14.9 weeks; biologic-experienced: 92.8%). Nineteen adverse events were reported (17.1%; incidence rate: 28.2 per 100 patient years), including 11 cases of hypercholesterolemia and 3 infections (no cases of herpes zoster reactivation. At week 8, the rates of clinical response, steroid free clinical remission, and CRP normalization were 74.8%, 45.0%, and 56.9%, respectively, and 68.5%, 51.4%, and 65.2%, respectively, at the end of follow-up. Eighteen patients experienced a loss of response after successful induction (21.7%; incidence rate: 33.2 per 100 patient years). Twenty-six patients (23.4%) discontinued TOFA over time, of whom 3 due to AEs, and 23 to non response or loss of response. Conclusions:TOFA is safe and effective in patients with UC, including those with history of multiple failures to biological therapies.",

        "abstract": "Background and objective:The effectiveness of immunosuppressive and corticosteroid treatments for Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) remains thoroughly evaluated. We undertook a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of low-dose corticosteroids plus leflunomide for progressive IgA nephropathy. Methods:Eligible studies were obtained from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. We also searched the references of the included studies. Our protocol followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Eligibility criteria were defined using a PICOS framework. Results:Our study included three articles presenting 342 patient cases. Findings revealed that low-dose corticosteroids combined with the leflunomide group were effective in relieving urine protein excretion (UPE) [mean difference (MD) = -0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.41 to -0.30, P < 0.00001] compared with the full-dose corticosteroids group. Regarding serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), complete remission rate, and overall response rate, there was no difference between the groups (p > 0.05). Regarding safety, low-dose corticosteroids combined with leflunomide significantly reduced the risk of serious adverse events [odds ratio (OR): 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.91, P = 0.04]. Besides, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in the incidence of respiratory infection, abnormal liver function, diarrhea, herpes zoster, alopecia, pruritus, insomnia, pneumonia, diabetes, and urinary tract infection (P > 0.05). Conclusions:Low-dose corticosteroids combined with leflunomide are a safe and effective treatment for progressive IgA nephropathy.

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered an unprecedented concentration of economic and research efforts to generate knowledge at unequalled speed on deregulated interferon type I signalling and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB)-driven interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-18 secretion causing cytokine storms. The translation of the knowledge on how the resulting systemic inflammation can lead to life-threatening complications into novel treatments and vaccine technologies is underway. Nevertheless, previously existing knowledge on the role of cytoplasmatic or circulating self-DNA as a pro-inflammatory damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) was largely ignored. Pathologies reported 'de novo' for patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 to be outcomes of self-DNA-driven inflammation in fact had been linked earlier to self-DNA in different contexts, e.g., the infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1, sterile inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. I highlight particularly how synergies with other DAMPs can render immunogenic properties to normally non-immunogenic extracellular self-DNA, and I discuss the shared features of the gp41 unit of the HIV-1 envelope protein and the SARS-CoV 2 Spike protein that enable HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 to interact with cell or nuclear membranes, trigger syncytia formation, inflict damage to their host's DNA, and trigger inflammation - likely for their own benefit. These similarities motivate speculations that similar mechanisms to those driven by gp41 can explain how inflammatory self-DNA contributes to some of most frequent adverse events after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech) or the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, i.e., myocarditis, herpes zoster, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune nephritis or hepatitis, new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus, and flare-ups of psoriasis or lupus. The hope is to motivate a wider application of the lessons learned from the experiences with COVID-19 and the new mRNA vaccines to combat future non-COVID-19 diseases.",

        "abstract": "Background:Information related to herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and 2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroprevalence in France is either lacking, incomplete, or outdated, despite their public health burden. Method:We used routinely collected serological data between 2018 and 2022 to estimate HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, and CMV seroprevalence in France. To account for demographic differences between our analytic samples and the French population and get estimates for sparsely sampled districts and age classes, we used a multilevel regression and poststratification approach combined with Bayesian model averagingviastacking weights. Results:The observed seroprevalence (number of positive tests/number of tests) were 64.6% (93,294/144,424), 16.9% (24,316/144,159), 93.0% (141,419/152,084), 83.4% (63,199/75, 781), and 49.0% (23,276/47,525), respectively, for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, and CMV. Between 2018 and 2022, France had a model-based average (equal-tailed interval at 95%) expected seroprevalence equal to 61.1% (60.7,61.5), 14.5% (14.2,14.81), 89.5% (89.3,89.8), 85.6% (85.2,86.0), and 50.5% (49.3,51.7), respectively, for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV, and CMV infections. We found an almost certain lower expected seroprevalence in Metropolitan France than in overseas territories for all viruses but VZV, for which it was almost certainly greater. The expected seroprevalences were likely greater among females for all viruses. Limitations:Our results relied on the assumption that individuals were sampled at random conditionally to variables used to build the poststratification table. Implications:The analysis highlights spatial and demographic patterns in seroprevalence that should be considered for designing tailored public health policies.",

        "abstract": "Women infected during pregnancy with TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Other, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex viruses) pathogens have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes including stillbirth / miscarriage because of mother-to-child transmission. To investigate these risks in pregnant women in Kenya, we analyzed serum specimens from a pregnancy cohort study at three healthcare facilities. A sample of 481 participants was selected for TORCH pathogen antibody testing to determine seroprevalence. A random selection of 285 from the 481 participants was selected to measure seroconversion. These sera were tested using an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against 10 TORCH pathogens. We found that the seroprevalence of all but three of the 10 TORCH pathogens at enrollment was >30%, except forBordetella pertussis(3.8%),Treponema pallidum(11.4%), and varicella zoster virus (0.5%). Conversely, very few participants seroconverted during their pregnancy and were herpes simplex virus type 2 (n= 24, 11.2%), parvovirus B19 (n= 14, 6.2%), and rubella (n= 12, 5.1%). For birth outcomes, 88% of the participant had live births and 12% had stillbirths or miscarriage. Cytomegalovirus positivity at enrolment had a statistically significant positive association with a live birth outcome (p= 0.0394). Of the 10 TORCH pathogens tested, none had an association with adverse pregnancy outcome.",

        "abstract": "Although central nervous system infection following varicella zoster virus infection is relatively common, subsequent peripheral nervous system infection is comparatively rare. The present case documents a case of meningitis after varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, which was then followed by peripheral facial palsy. Specifically, a 54-year-old female patient was first admitted to Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital (Dongying, China) with headache and fever. Physical examination revealed herpes that formed along the intercostal nerve in the left forebreast, armpit and back. Subsequently, neurological examination found cervical resistance in more than three fingers (neck resistance of less than two transverse fingers is not evidence of meningeal irritation; the neck resistance of this patient was approximately three transverse fingers, so the patient was presumed to be positive for meningeal irritation, highly suggestive of meningitis) and Kernig sign was positive. There were no significant abnormalities according to brain MRI and lumbar puncture pressure was 330 mmH2O. In addition, the leukocyte count was 734x106/l, 50% monocyte count, 50% multinucleated cells, chloride levels of 109.1 mmol/l, protein levels of 235 mg/dl and glucose levels of 4.18 mmol/l in the cerebrospinal fluid. DNA and RNA metagenomic detection of pathogenic microorganisms in the cerebrospinal fluid revealed the presence of VZV. The patient was therefore treated with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, mannitol and methylprednisolone, but then developed right peripheral facial palsy at 10 days after treatment. This complication was not found in the literature, and the occurrence of facial neuritis was unexpected. The active period of VZV virus was 21 days, and the patient had herpes 5 days before admission. The active period of the virus was considered to have subsided and the patient was in the recovery period. Moreover, the results of lumbar puncture showed that the white blood cells, the proportion of neutrophils and the protein in cerebrospinal fluid were all decreasing, which also indicated that the patient had entered the recovery period. The patient was discharged 18 days after admission. In conclusion, observations from the present case suggested that the clinical manifestations of VZV infection can be complex and varied, requiring the clinician to have an accurate understanding of its disease progression and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Risankizumab has demonstrated a favourable safety profile in patients with psoriatic disease (moderate-to-severe psoriasis [PsO] and psoriatic arthritis [PsA]). We evaluated the long-term safety of risankizumab in psoriatic disease. Methods:Long-term safety was evaluated by analysing data from 20 (phase 1-4) clinical trials for plaque PsO and four (phase 2-3) trials for PsA. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and AEs in areas of special interest were reported among patients receiving ≥ 1 dose of risankizumab. Exposure-adjusted event rates were presented as events (E) per 100 patient-years (PY). Results:The long-term safety data analyses included 3658 patients with PsO (13,329.3 PY) and 1542 patients with PsA (3803.0 PY). The median (range) treatment duration for patients with PsO and PsA was 4.1 (0.2-8.8) years and 2.8 (0.2-4.0) years, respectively. In the PsO population, rates of TEAEs, serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were 145.5 E/100 PY, 7.4 E/100 PY and 1.9 E/100 PY, respectively; in the PsA population, these rates were 142.6 E/100 PY, 8.6 E/100 PY, and 1.8 E/100 PY, respectively. The rates of serious infections (excluding COVID-19-related infections) in the PsO and PsA populations were 1.2 and 1.4 E/100 PY, respectively. The rates of opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis and herpes zoster) were low (< 0.1 E/100 PY) in both populations. The rates of both nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and malignant tumours excluding NMSC were 0.6 and 0.5 E/100 PY in PsO and PsA, respectively, which are within the benchmarks of prior epidemiological studies. Adjudicated major cardiovascular event rates were 0.5 E/100 PY in PsO and 0.3 E/100 PY in PsA, which are within the epidemiologic reference benchmarks for both indications. No additional safety concerns were identified with this long-term exposure. Conclusions:The results support the favourable safety profile of risankizumab for long-term treatment of psoriatic disease with no new safety concerns and similar safety profiles among both PsO and PsA populations.",

        "abstract": "The mucosa of the oral cavity is exposed to a large number of different microorganisms such as archaea, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Among those, viruses cause specific infections, which can easily be transmitted from one person to another. The infectious route may not only include patients and their relatives but also the dental professional team. Thus, a wide knowledge regarding specific viral infections is crucial for the daily routine. Signs and symptoms of oral viral infections can be completely absent or develop into a pronounced clinical picture, so that early detection and information determine the further course of the infection and its influence on other inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis, as well as the safety of family members and the social environment. As the clinical manifestation of viral infections may be highly variable leading to heterogenous mucosal lesions it is, in most cases, mandatory to differentiate them by specific microbiological tests in addition to clinical examination procedures. This article will give an overview of the role of viruses infecting the oral mucosa, and in addition, describe their clinical manifestation and management.",

The primary outcome was safety and key secondary endpoints were efficacy, based on hematological parameters, quality of life measurements, and JAK2V617F variant allele frequency (VAF). We used the 2013 ELN and IWG-MRT remission criteria. The remission criteria included remissions in symptoms, splenomegaly, peripheral blood counts, and bone marrow. We included 25 patients with PV with a median age of 70 years; 5 of those had prior thromboembolic events and three had CT-verified splenomegaly. Two patients stopped both study drugs, one of these due to progression to post-PV myelofibrosis; only that patient had a grade 3 infection. No events of herpes zoster infections were observed. No patients discontinued treatment due to psychiatric symptoms. The peripheral blood cell count remission rate was 92% at 24 months. Using the 2013 ELN and IWG-MRT remission criteria, 14 (56%) achieved remission at 24 months; 3 (12%) achieved complete remission, and 11 (44%) achieved partial remission. The following items from the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Total Symptom Score were significantly reduced: abdominal discomfort, night sweats, itching, and bone pain. The median JAK2V617F VAF decreased from 47% (95%CI, 35-59%) to 7% (95%CI, 3-15%), and 60% of patients achieved molecular remission. In conclusion, combination treatment improved cell counts; bone marrow cellularity, and fibrosis; and decreased JAK2V617F VAF; with acceptable toxicity in patients with polycythemia vera.

        "abstract": "Background:Previous clinical trials presented efficacy and safety of Janus kinase 1 inhibitor upadacitinib through 52 weeks for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Objectives:To assess the effectiveness and safety of upadacitinib through 48 weeks in real-world clinical practice for Japanese AD patients (aged ≥12 years). Methods:This retrospective study included 287 patients with moderate-to severe AD treated with 15 mg (n= 216) or 30 mg (n= 71) of upadacitinib daily. Effectiveness was assessed using eczema area severity index (EASI) scores, atopic dermatitis control tool (ADCT), peak pruritus-numerical rating scale (PP-NRS), and investigator's global assessment (IGA). Safety was evaluated through the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Results:From baseline, EASI, ADCT, PP-NRS, and IGA rapidly reduced at week 4, and the reduction was maintained until week 48 of treatment with upadacitinib at both doses. Achievement rates of EASI 75, EASI 90, and EASI 100 at week 48 were 63.5, 30.2, and 7.9 in 15 mg group, and 77.4, 54.8, and 3.2% in 30 mg group, respectively. Acne and herpes zoster were frequent, but no serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions:Upadacitinib was therapeutically effective and tolerable for moderate-to-severe AD through 48 weeks in real-world clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Vaccination rates among Canadian adults remain suboptimal. Community pharmacists have increasingly adopted an active role in vaccination and are trusted by the public to provide vaccination-related advice and care. The aim of this prospective descriptive study was to develop and test a novel clinical service, VaxCheck, to support proactive life-course vaccination assessments by community pharmacists. From October 2022-May 2023, 123 VaxCheck consultations were performed at 9 community pharmacies within the Wholehealth Pharmacy Partners banner in Ontario, Canada. Patient age averaged 60 years and 35.8 % had at least one chronic disease risk factor, 17.7 % had lifestyle-related risk factor(s), and 15.4 % were immunocompromised. 95.1 % of VaxCheck consultations resulted in at least one vaccine recommendation, averaging three vaccines per patient. Most frequently recommended vaccines were those against pneumococcal disease, tetanus/diphtheria, herpes zoster, COVID-19, and influenza, with acceptance rates highest for those available without a prescription and at no charge at the pharmacy. Patient feedback was positive with 85 % of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that they would recommend the service to others. Vaccine administration at the time of the consultation occurred with only 5.9 % of recommended vaccines, frequently impacted by limitations to scope of practice related to pharmacist ability to prescribe and/or administer the vaccine and lack of pharmacy access to publicly funded vaccine supply for those meeting eligibility criteria. Community pharmacists performing a VaxCheck consultation can proactively identify indicated vaccines for patients. Expansion in scope of practice and access to publicly funded vaccine is recommended to further support vaccine uptake.",

        "abstract": "Background and importance:The rates of hidden infection and late diagnosis of HIV still remain high in Western countries. Missed diagnostic opportunities represent the key point in changing the course of the epidemic. Objective:To evaluate the feasibility and results of implementation of a selective strategy to test for HIV in the emergency department (ED) in patients with six pre-defined medical situations: sexually transmitted infections, herpes zoster, community-acquired pneumonia, mononucleosis syndrome, practice of chemsex (CS) or request of post-exposure prophylaxis. Design:This quasi-experimental longitudinal study evaluated the pre- and post-implementation results of HIV testing in the six aforementioned clinical scenarios. Settings and participants:Patients attended 34 Spanish EDs. Intervention or exposure:The intervention was an intensive educational program and pathways to facilitate and track orders and results were designed. We collected and compared pre- and post-implementation ED census and diagnoses, and HIV tests requested and results. Outcome measures and analysis:The main outcome was adherence to the recommendations. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate the effectiveness of the program by the rate of positive test and the new HIV diagnoses. Differences between first and second periods were assessed. The magnitude of changes (absolute and relative) was expressed with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Main results:HIV tests increasing from 7080 (0.42% of ED visits) to 13 436 (relative increase of 75%, 95% CI from 70 to 80%). The six conditions were diagnosed in 15 879 and 16 618 patients, and HIV testing was ordered in 3393 (21%) and 7002 (42%) patients (increase: 97%; 95% CI: 90-104%). HIV testing significantly increased for all conditions except for CS. The positive HIV test rates increased from 0.92 to 1.67%. Detection of persons with undiagnosed HIV increased from 65 to 224, which implied a 220% (95% CI: 143-322%) increase of HIV diagnosis among all ED comers and a 71% (95% CI: 30-125%) increase of positive HIV tests. Conclusion:Implementation of a strategy to test for HIV in selective clinical situations in the ED is feasible and may lead to a substantial increase in HIV testing and diagnoses.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of anifrolumab 300 mg, alongside standard therapy, in patients from Japan with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the TULIP-LTE trial (NCT02794285). Methods:TULIP-LTE was a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled long-term extension (LTE) of the TULIP trials. The primary safety outcome included serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs of special interest (AESIs) during the LTE period. Exploratory efficacy outcomes included SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2 K) scores and glucocorticoid use. We performed a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients who enrolled in Japan. Results:Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of SAEs during the LTE and follow-up for patients receiving anifrolumab 300 mg (n = 21) were 8.7 per 100 patient-years; AESIs included influenza (6.9) and herpes zoster (3.5). One of three patients receiving placebo had an SAE (13.9). One patient per group discontinued due to an AE. There were no deaths. During the TULIP + LTE period, patients receiving anifrolumab 300 mg (n = 24) had sustained reduction from baseline in mean SLEDAI-2 K scores and cumulative glucocorticoid dosage. Conclusions:Anifrolumab 300 mg showed a favourable benefit-risk profile for the long-term treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe SLE from Japan, with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles consistent with the overall population.",

        "abstract": "Background:Oral corticosteroids are first-line agents to induce remission in moderately active ulcerative colitis [UC], but are associated with adverse effects. We compared the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib and prednisolone for induction of remission in moderately active UC. Methods:This was a single-centre, prospective, open-label, randomized, active-controlled pilot study. Eligible patients [aged ≥18 years] had moderately active UC. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either prednisolone [40 mg daily, tapered by 5 mg every week] or tofacitinib [10 mg twice daily] for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was composite remission [defined as total Mayo clinic score ≤2, with endoscopic sub-score of 0 and faecal calprotectin <100 µg/g] at 8 weeks. Results:Seventy-eight patients were randomly assigned to either of the treatment groups. At week 8, the proportion of patients achieving composite remission in the tofacitinib [7/43, 16.28%] and prednisolone groups [3/35, 8.57%] were not significantly different (odds ratio [OR] 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-8.70; p = 0.31). The time to achieve symptomatic remission [normal stool frequency with absence of rectal bleeding] was similar (10 days, interquartile range [IQR 7-18.75] and 10 days [IQR 5-12.5] for tofacitinib and prednisolone, respectively; p = 0.25) in the two groups. One patient each in the tofacitinib and prednisolone group discontinued treatment due to development of pulmonary tuberculosis and pustular acne, respectively. One patient receiving tofacitinib developed herpes zoster, but did not require cessation of therapy. No serious adverse events or major adverse cardiovascular events were observed. Conclusion:In patients with moderately active UC, there was no difference in the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib and oral prednisolone for induction of remission at 8 weeks.

        "title": "Two Waves of Specific B Cell Memory Immunoreconstruction Observed in Anti-HHV1-3 IgG Kinetics after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation",
        "abstract": "Background:Humoral memory and specific antibody levels depend on the kind of antigen and individual immunofactors. The presence of IgM antibodies or a fourfold rise in specific IgG levels are generally accepted as diagnostic factors in the serology of acute viral infections. This basic model is not adequate for the herpes virome, especially after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), due to continuous, usually multifocal antigenic stimulation, various donor serostatuses, immunosuppression, and individual immunoreconstitution. Methods:A case-control study was conducted to identify active infection cases of human herpesvirus (HHV) (from 300 diagnosed immunocompromised patients) and to evaluate historically associated humoral factors to look at outcomes. We considered only the data of patients with meticulous differential diagnosis to exclude other causes, and thereby to observe pathways and temporal relationships, not the statistical ones usually collected in cohorts. Despite the small number, such data collection and analysis methods avoid a number of biases and indicate cause and effect. Results:In this observational study, a retrospective analysis of data from 300 patients with clinical diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation showed a number of biases. Two well-differentiated cases (confirmed by a Tzanck test) with various diseases and conditioning evolutions of immune parameters showed an interesting pathway. Exponential decreases in specific IgGs after HSCT preceded virus replication were observed, with a cytopathic effect (shingles, VZV encephalitis and HSV-induced mucositis). The minima (lowest IgG levels) before herpesvirus reactivation were 234.23 mIU/mL and 94 RU/mL for VZV and HSV, respectively. This coincided with a low CD4 titer, but without other infectious processes. Other immune response parameters such as Treg, cytotoxic T cells, and complement and total IgG level were the same as they were before the transplant procedure. Interestingly, a second wave of immunoreconstitution with an anamnestic antibody response was not always observed. It coincided with prolonged herpes viral infection. A patient with lymphocyte depletion in conditioning showed an earlier second wave of immunoreconstitution (6th vs. 14th month). Conclusions:As is typical for infancy, the kinetics of the IgG level is unique after HSCT (the decline phase is first). Host microbiome factors (e.g., HHV1-3-serostatus) should be taken into account to predict risk of non-relapse mortality and survival after HSCT. The levels of specific antibodies help in predicting prognoses and improve disease management. A lack of differentiation and the confusing bias of the assessor (i.e., observer selection bias) are the main obstacles in statistical HHV1-3 research. Such time-lapse case studies may be the first to build evidence of a pathway and an association between immune parameters and HHV disease.",

        "abstract": "Herpesviruses establish latent infections, and most reactivate frequently, resulting in symptoms and virus shedding in healthy individuals. In immunocompromised patients, reactivating virus can cause severe disease. Persistent EBV has been associated with several malignancies in both immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised persons. Reactivation and shedding occur with most herpesviruses, despite potent virus-specific antibodies and T cell immunity as measured in the blood. The licensure of therapeutic vaccines to reduce zoster indicates that effective therapeutic vaccines for other herpesviruses should be feasible. However, varicella-zoster virus is different from other human herpesviruses in that it is generally only shed during varicella and zoster. Unlike prophylactic vaccines, in which the correlate of immunity is antibody function, T cell immunity is the correlate of immunity for the only effective therapeutic herpesvirus vaccine-zoster vaccine. While most studies of therapeutic vaccines have measured immunity in the blood, cellular immunity at the site of reactivation is likely critical for an effective therapeutic vaccine for certain viruses. This Review summarizes the status of therapeutic vaccines for herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus and proposes approaches for future development.",

They described six cases of panuveitis with vitritis, retinal periarteritis, peripheral confluent areas of retinal necrosis, and retinal detachment. ARN has also been called as Kirisawa's uveitis in Japan.",

        "abstract": "Background:Real-world evidence of the efficacy and adverse events of JAK inhibitor treatment (Tofacitinib, Baricitinib, Upadacitinib, and Filgotinib) in rheumatoid arthritis is still limited.Methods:We studied 115 patients from the Rheumatology Unit of S. Giovanni di Dio Hospital affected by D2T-RA, according to the 2010 EULAR criteria. Out of the 115 patients, 17 had been treated with Baricitinib 8 mg/daily, 32 with Filgotinib 200 mg/daily, 21 with Tofacitinib 10 mg/daily, and 45 with Upadacitinib 15 mg/daily. We evaluated the clinical response after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment and the follow-up from September 2022 to September 2023. All patients were evaluated according to the number of tender joints (NTJs), number of swollen joints (NSJs), visual analog scale (VAS), global assessment (GA), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), Disease Activity Score (DAS28), and CDAI. Furthermore, laboratory parameters of efficacy and tolerability were evaluated.Results:All treatments demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the DAS28 and CDAI scores, tender and swollen joint counts, VAS, HAQ, and patient global assessment (PGA) after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. All treatments showed similar behavior, and statistically significant decreases in circulating calprotectin, TNFα, and IL-6 were observed for all drugs after 12 months of treatment. In addition, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) values showed significant differences at baseline and after 12 months of treatment for Filgotinib: 4.87 ± 4.53 vs. 3.61 ± 0.9 (0.009) and Upadacitinib: 6.64 ± 7.12 vs. 4.06 ± 3.61 (0.0003), while no statistically significant differences were found for Baricitinib: 3.4 ± 0.1 vs. 3.78 ± 0.1 and Tofacitinib: 3.95 ± 1.77 vs. 2.58 ± 0.1. The TC/HDL-C ratio (atherogenic index) showed significant differences when comparing Baricitinib vs. Filgotinib (0.0012), Filgotinib vs. Tofacitinib (0.0095), and Filgotinib vs. Upadacitinib (0.0001); furthermore, the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio in the Filgotinib group did not change (2.37 ± 0.45 vs. 2.35 ± 2.13 (NS)) after 12 months of treatment. Venous Thrombotic Events (VTEs) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) accounted for 1% of adverse events after treatment with Baricitinib.Herpes zosterreactivation accounted for 1% of adverse events after treatment with Filgotinib and Tofacitinib, while non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) accounted for 1% of adverse events after Upadacitinib treatment.Conclusions:Our real-world data from patients with RA show differences in some laboratory parameters and in the impact of lipid metabolism in JAK inhibitor treatment.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:Determine domain-based-outcomes and steroid-sparing efficacy of generic tofacitinib in IIM. Methods:This is a multicenter retrospective study wherein clinical phenotype, autoantibody profile, prior immunosuppressives, and outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months were retrieved for IIM patients prescribed tofacitinib. Overall clinical response was assessed as complete or partial remission as per physician judgment. Changes in cutaneous and calcinosis domain were recorded as per physician global assessment (PGA), lung domain as per medical research council (MRC) dyspnea scale, and muscle strength by Manual Muscle Testing-8 (MMT-8). Results:Forty-two patients of IIM with mean age 38.7 ± 16 years; (76.2% (N = 32) women), median duration of illness 48 (19;88) months were included. Commonest indication for initiating tofacitinib was either for refractory or as steroid sparing for cutaneous domain (N = 25/42, 59.5%) followed by calcinosis (N = 16/42, 38%). Overall complete and/or partial remission was achieved in 23/37 (64.8%), 30/35 (85.7%), and 29/30 (96.6%) patients at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. At 12-month follow-up, there was a reduction in prednisolone dose, with absolute decrease from a daily dose of 17.5 mg (IQR 5;50) to 2.5 mg (IQR 0;5) (p < 0.001). Individual domain assessments revealed improvement in cutaneous domain [16/25 (64%)] and calcinosis [6/15 (40%)]. Adverse effects included herpes zoster (N = 2/42, 4.8%) and dyslipidemia (N = 4/42, 9.5%). Conclusions:Treatment with generic tofacitinib significantly reduces the daily dose of corticosteroids and is effective in cutaneous domain including calcinosis in IIM. Key points:• This multicenter retrospective study is the first real-world data from India, elucidating steroid sparing efficacy of generic tofacitinib in patients with inflammatory myositis. • Domain-based outcome assessment suggests good clinical improvement especially in cutaneous domain, even those with refractory disease. • Modest benefits were evident in calcinosis, but its effect on the muscle and pulmonary domain appears limited.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:This study aimed to describe the long-term efficacy and safety of upadacitinib and adalimumab through 228 weeks following immediate switch to the alternate therapy with a different mechanism of action (MoA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not achieving treatment goals with their initial randomized therapy in the ongoing phase 3 SELECT-COMPARE study. Methods:Patients with non-response or incomplete response to initially prescribed upadacitinib 15 mg once daily or adalimumab 40 mg every other week were switched to the alternate therapy by week 26. Efficacy was evaluated through 228 weeks post-switch using validated outcome measures, including Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) low disease activity (LDA; ≤ 10)/remission (≤ 2.8); 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on C-reactive protein ≤ 3.2/< 2.6; ≥ 20%/50%/70% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria; and change from baseline in ACR core components. Data are reported as observed. Safety was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) through week 264. Results:Of patients initially randomized to upadacitinib and adalimumab, 38.7% and 48.6%, respectively, switched to the alternate therapy by week 26. Clinically relevant improvements in all efficacy measures were observed through 228 weeks post-switch and were generally similar between groups, with small numeric differences mostly in favor of switching to upadacitinib. CDAI remission was achieved by 32.7% and 28.6% of initial non-responders, and 27.5% and 27.3% of incomplete responders, while CDAI LDA was achieved by 76.9% and 72.9% of non-responders, and 72.5% and 72.7% of incomplete responders switching to upadacitinib and to adalimumab, respectively. TEAE rates were similar between groups, although herpes zoster infection, lymphopenia, and creatine phosphokinase elevation were more frequent when switching to upadacitinib. No new safety signals were identified. Conclusion:Switching to a different MoA may provide long-term benefit to patients with RA not achieving treatment goals with their initial therapy, with acceptable safety profiles.

        "abstract": "Background:We provide the first prospective longitudinal multicenter experience on Upadacitinib efficacy and safety profile in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in a real-life context, focusing on clinimetric and ultrasonographic (US) data. Methods:RA patients referred to three Italian tertiary Centers who started Upadacitinib were enrolled as per ACR/EULAR classification criteria and prospectively reviewed. The primary aim of this study was to assess changes in clinimetric and ultrasonographic scores through time (at baseline, after 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months from the beginning of the therapy). Secondary aims were to: (i) estimate the impact of biologic lines of treatment and concomitant therapies on response to therapy; (ii) explore changes in laboratory parameters; and (iii) find potential predictive factors associated with response to therapy. Results:Seventy-one patients (49 Females and 22 Males) were included. Clinimetric scores, including the Disease Activity Score (DAS28-CRP) and Simplified Clinical Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and US findings (synovial hypertrophy and power Doppler) significantly improved (p= 0.029,p= 0.001,p= 0.001,p= 0.001, respectively). Regression analysis revealed a significant association between the concomitant csDMARDs therapy at baseline and the lack of improvement in synovial hypertrophy [OR -4.824,p= 0.010] as well as with DAS28-CRP [OR -0.690,p= 0.045], whereas the presence of increased ESR or CRP at baseline was able to predict a significant improvement in SDAI [OR 8.481,p= 0.003]. No adverse events, such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or herpes zoster virus infection, were reported during this study observation. Conclusion:Our real-life experience confirms the efficacy of Upadacitinib in terms of clinical and ultrasonographic improvement, as well as displaying a good safety profile.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:This study aimed to evaluate the relative association between sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ra) with the incidence of gout in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using real-world data. Methods:We conducted a cohort study using data from TriNetX (an international federated database). We included patients commenced on metformin or insulin, either alone or with an SGLT2i or GLP-1Ra, at least 2 years prior to date of analysis. We propensity score matched (PSM) (1:1) for 26 relevant characteristics. Time to event analysis was performed to assess the incidence of gout, all-cause mortality (positive control), and herpes zoster infection (negative control) at 5 years following drug initiation. Findings:Prior to PSM, the cohort numbers were as follows: metformin control, 1,111,449; SGLT2i with metformin, 101,706; GLP-1Ra with metformin, 110,180, insulin control, 1,398,066; SGLT2i with insulin, 68,697; and GLP-1Ra with insulin, 99,693. SGLT2i with metformin demonstrated a statistically significant decreased incidence of gout at 5 years compared to the metformin control cohort (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.69-0.82], P < 0.0001). Similarly, SGLT2i with insulin demonstrated a statistically significant decreased incidence of gout at 5 years compared to the insulin control cohort (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.92], P < 0.0001). Conversely, no significant disparity in gout incidence was observed between the use of GLP-1Ra and matched controls. Subgroup analysis showed an associated reduced incidence of gout with SGLT2i use compared to GLP-1Ra, in groups using metformin (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.70-0.86], P < 0.0001) or insulin (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73-0.91)], P < 0.0001). Implications:In this large-scale real-world study, SGLT2i use was associated with a lower incidence of gout in patients with T2D compared to both insulin and metformin controls. These findings suggest the potential of SGLT2i as a promising therapeutic option for treating gout in this population.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:We evaluated the real-world safety/effectiveness of tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), in patients with RA in Japan registered in a post-marketing surveillance study. Methods:This interim analysis included data from July 2013 to December 2018. Adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)/Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)/Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28-4(ESR)] scores, and rates of SDAI/CDAI/DAS28-4(ESR)-defined remission and low disease activity were analysed using 6 months of data. Risk factors for serious infections were assessed by multivariable analyses. Results:Safety and disease activity were evaluated in 6866 and 6649 patients, respectively. Overall, 32.73%/7.37% of patients reported AEs/SAEs. Clinically important AEs with tofacitinib included serious infections/infestations [3.13% of patients; incidence rate (IR; patients with events) 6.91/100 patient-years (PY)], herpes zoster (3.63%; IR 8.02/100 PY), and malignancies (0.68%; IR 1.45/100 PY). SDAI/CDAI/DAS28-4(ESR) scores and remission/low disease activity rates improved over 6 months. Male sex, older age, Steinbrocker's stage IV, history of infection, and diabetes mellitus at baseline were independent risk factors for serious infection. Conclusions:In patients with RA receiving tofacitinib in Japan, safety was consistent with the reported profile, and disease activity improved over 6 months. Study identifier:NCT01932372.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:This study involves the collation and analysis of clinical characteristics and laboratory findings in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) combined with renal insufficiency. The objective was to assess the impact of various treatment methods on patient outcomes and the incidence of adverse events in individuals with MM and renal insufficiency. Methods:We analyzed the correlation between clinical characteristics, gene loci, fluorescence in situ hybridization, treatment methods, and prognosis in patients with MM and renal insufficiency. The differences in hematological and therapeutic efficacy indexes between two groups subjected to different treatments were evaluated. The assessment of treatment effectiveness was based on the total effective rate, calculated as the sum of stringent CR rate, complete remission rate, very good partial remission rate, and partial remission rate. Results:(1) The renal insufficiency group exhibited higher percentages of bone marrow abnormal plasma cells, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood calcium, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophils, and blood β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) levels compared to the normal renal function group. Conversely, hemoglobin levels and lymphocyte percentage were lower in the renal insufficiency group. Binary logistic regression analysis identified hemoglobin, blood calcium values, blood β2-MG, and LDH as independent risk factors for the development of renal insufficiency in patients with MM (p &lt; 0.05). (2) Based on the Durie-Salmon staging criteria, the proportion of Stage III patients was the highest (up to 81.8%), indicating that patients with MM usually suffer from insidious disease, often with high tumor load and late-disease stage at the time of consultation. International Staging System (ISS) and Revised ISS staging also revealed a higher proportion of Stage III patients in the renal insufficiency group (p &lt; 0.05), indicating a worse long-term prognosis in patients with MM and renal insufficiency. (3) Before treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the analysis of various indices. Complications such as sepsis, herpes zoster, peripheral neuropathy, thrombosis, secondary pulmonary infection, and cardiac complications were significantly lower in the BCD group (Bortezomib + Cyclophosphamide + Dexamethasone) compared to the BD group (Bortezomib + Dexamethasone) (χ2 = 6.333, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting fewer complications with the BCD regimen. (4) The clinical treatment effects analysis indicated that the BCD group demonstrated a more significant impact than the BD group in the treatment of MM. Conclusion:The application of the BCD regimen in the treatment of MM has shown significant efficiency, effectively alleviating clinical symptoms with fewer adverse reactions and high safety.",

        "title": "Assessing the Application of Large Language Models in Generating Dermatologic Patient Education Materials According to Reading Level: Qualitative Study",
        "abstract": "Background:Dermatologic patient education materials (PEMs) are often written above the national average seventh- to eighth-grade reading level. ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, DermGPT, and DocsGPT are large language models (LLMs) that are responsive to user prompts. Our project assesses their use in generating dermatologic PEMs at specified reading levels. Objective:This study aims to assess the ability of select LLMs to generate PEMs for common and rare dermatologic conditions at unspecified and specified reading levels. Further, the study aims to assess the preservation of meaning across such LLM-generated PEMs, as assessed by dermatology resident trainees. Methods:The Flesch-Kincaid reading level (FKRL) of current American Academy of Dermatology PEMs was evaluated for 4 common (atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and herpes zoster) and 4 rare (epidermolysis bullosa, bullous pemphigoid, lamellar ichthyosis, and lichen planus) dermatologic conditions. We prompted ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, DermGPT, and DocsGPT to \"Create a patient education handout about [condition] at a [FKRL]\" to iteratively generate 10 PEMs per condition at unspecified fifth- and seventh-grade FKRLs, evaluated with Microsoft Word readability statistics. The preservation of meaning across LLMs was assessed by 2 dermatology resident trainees. Results:The current American Academy of Dermatology PEMs had an average (SD) FKRL of 9.35 (1.26) and 9.50 (2.3) for common and rare diseases, respectively. For common diseases, the FKRLs of LLM-produced PEMs ranged between 9.8 and 11.21 (unspecified prompt), between 4.22 and 7.43 (fifth-grade prompt), and between 5.98 and 7.28 (seventh-grade prompt). For rare diseases, the FKRLs of LLM-produced PEMs ranged between 9.85 and 11.45 (unspecified prompt), between 4.22 and 7.43 (fifth-grade prompt), and between 5.98 and 7.28 (seventh-grade prompt). At the fifth-grade reading level, GPT-4 was better at producing PEMs for both common and rare conditions than ChatGPT-3.5 (P=.001 and P=.01, respectively), DermGPT (P<.001 and P=.03, respectively), and DocsGPT (P<.001 and P=.02, respectively). At the seventh-grade reading level, no significant difference was found between ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4, DocsGPT, or DermGPT in producing PEMs for common conditions (all P>.05); however, for rare conditions, ChatGPT-3.5 and DocsGPT outperformed GPT-4 (P=.003 and P<.001, respectively). The preservation of meaning analysis revealed that for common conditions, DermGPT ranked the highest for overall ease of reading, patient understandability, and accuracy (14.75/15, 98%); for rare conditions, handouts generated by GPT-4 ranked the highest (14.5/15, 97%). Conclusions:GPT-4 appeared to outperform ChatGPT-3.5, DocsGPT, and DermGPT at the fifth-grade FKRL for both common and rare conditions, although both ChatGPT-3.5 and DocsGPT performed better than GPT-4 at the seventh-grade FKRL for rare conditions. LLM-produced PEMs may reliably meet seventh-grade FKRLs for select common and rare dermatologic conditions and are easy to read, understandable for patients, and mostly accurate. LLMs may play a role in enhancing health literacy and disseminating accessible, understandable PEMs in dermatology.",

        "abstract": "Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is an inflammatory disease that is primarily caused by herpesvirus infection, most commonly varicella-zoster virus (VZV), followed by herpes simplex virus (HSV) and occasionally cytomegalovirus (CMV). Sintilimab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that can enhance the body's anti-tumor immune response. However, treatment with ICIs may lead to reactivation of the VZV. Here, we present a case of ARN caused by VZV infection in a patient receiving sintilimab for cervical cancer. A 64-year-old female patient developed vision loss and floaters with left eye redness for one week after 22 cycles of sintilimab for cervical cancer. Based on clinical manifestations, ophthalmological examination, and vitreous humor biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with acute retinal necrosis syndrome secondary to VZV. After receiving systemic antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy, retinal necrosis lesions and visual function improved. In conclusion, clinicians should be aware of the risk of ARN when using sintilimab and should actively monitor patients for prompt diagnosis and optimal management of this rare adverse drug reaction.",

Methods:Nationwide cohort study of all Danish residents with positive CSF-AI or -PCR for HSV or VZV (1995-2021). We calculated short- and long-term risks as age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted odds ratios (aOR), adjusted hazard ratios (aHR), and absolute risk differences with 95% CIs. Results:Compared with individuals with positive PCR for HSV1 (n = 321), HSV2 (n = 497), and VZV (n = 1054), individuals with a positive AI for HSV (n = 177) and VZV (n = 219) had CSF pleocytosis less frequently (leucocyte count >10/μL: HSV-AI: 39%, VZV-AI: 52%, HSV1-PCR: 81%, HSV2-PCR: 92%, VZV-PCR: 83%), and were less frequently diagnosed with central nervous system infection ([aOR {95%CI}]: HSV-AI vs. HSV1-PCR: [0.1 {0.1, 0.2}], HSV-AI vs. HSV2-PCR: [0.1 {0.0, 0.1}], VZV-AI vs. VZV-PCR: [0.2 {0.2, 0.3}]). Individuals with a positive HSV-AI or VZV-AI had increased risk of demyelinating disease ([aOR {95%CI}; aHR {95%CI}]: HSV-AI vs. HSV1-PCR: [4.6 {0.9, 24.5}; aHR not applicable], HSV-AI vs. HSV2-PCR: [10.4 {2.3, 45.9}; 12.4 {2.3, 66.0}], VZV-AI vs. VZV-PCR: [aOR not applicable; 10.3 {1.8, 58.8}]). Disability pension was less frequent among HSV-AI than HSV1-PCR cohort members (5-year risk difference: -23.6%, 95%CI: -35.2, -11.8), and more frequent among VZV-AI than VZV-PCR cohort members (5-year risk difference: 16.8%, 95%CI: 5.0, 28.7). Discussion:AI-positive individuals differ from PCR-positive individuals in several aspects. AI appears unspecific for current central nervous system infections.",

This report presents a unique case of a 56-year-old man with GS, characterized by a thymoma, who developed cutaneous CMV and VZV co-infections. We discuss the clinical characteristics, diagnostic process, and treatment of this uncommon manifestation. A 56-year-old man with a mediastinal mass identified as thymoma type A and pleural metastasis, presented with a three-week progressive, painful generalized skin lesions on his face, trunk, and extremities. Upon further examination, multiple extensive vesicles with reddened bases were distributed throughout all regions of his body, some exhibited hemorrhagic characteristics. The histopathologic assessment indicated a herpes virus infection and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Additionally, Immunohistochemistry staining for CMV highlighted infected endothelial cells. The patient was diagnosed with disseminated cutaneous co-infection of CMV and VZV in the context of Good's syndrome. The patient responded well to a treatment regimen combining intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and ganciclovir therapy, leading to the complete resolution of skin lesions. He was recommended prophylactic treatment and showed significant improvement upon follow-up, ultimately being discharged in a favorable clinical condition. By gaining a better understanding of this condition, healthcare professionals can improve their ability to recognize and treat Good's syndrome effectively. Early identification and effective treatment have a crucial role in enhancing the prognosis.",

        "title": "Safety of Biological Therapies for Severe Asthma: An Analysis of Suspected Adverse Reactions Reported in the WHO Pharmacovigilance Database",
        "abstract": "Background:The management of uncontrolled severe asthma has greatly improved since the advent of novel biologic therapies. Up to August 2022, five biologics have been approved for the type 2 asthma phenotype: anti-IgE (omalizumab), anti-IL5 (mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab), and anti-IL4 (dupilumab) monoclonal antibodies. These drugs are usually well tolerated, although long-term safety information is limited, and some adverse events have not yet been fully characterized. Spontaneous reporting systems represent the cornerstone for the detection of potential signals and evaluation of the real-world safety of all marketed drugs. Objective:The aim of this study was to provide an overview of safety data of biologics for severe asthma using VigiBase, the World Health Organization global pharmacovigilance database. Methods:We selected all de-duplicated individual case safety reports (ICSRs) attributed to five approved biologics for severe asthma in VigiBase, up to 31st August 2022 (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab and dupilumab). Descriptive frequency analyses of ICSRs were carried out both as a whole class and as individual products. Reporting odds ratios (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used as the measure of disproportionality for suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the study drugs compared with either all other suspected drugs (Reference Group 1, RG1) or inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting β-agonists (ICSs/LABAs) (Reference Group 2, RG2) or with oral corticosteroids (OCSs) (Reference Group 3, RG3). Results:Overall, 31,724,381 ICSRs were identified in VigiBase and 167,282 (0.5%) were related to study drugs; the remaining reports were considered as RG1. Stratifying all biologic-related ICSRs by therapeutic indication, around 29.4% (n = 48,440) concerned asthma use; omalizumab was mainly indicated as the suspected drug (n = 20,501), followed by dupilumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab and reslizumab. Most asthma ICSRs concerned adults (57%) and women (64.1%). Asthma biologics showed a higher frequency of serious suspected ADR reporting than RG1 (41.3% vs 32.3%). The most reported suspected ADRs included asthma, dyspnea, product use issue, drug ineffective, cough, headache, fatigue and wheezing. Asthma biologics were disproportionally associated with several unknown or less documented adverse events, such as malignancies, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis with omalizumab; alopecia and lichen planus with dupilumab; alopecia and herpes infections with mepolizumab; alopecia, herpes zoster and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis related to benralizumab; and alopecia with reslizumab. Conclusions:The most frequently reported suspected ADRs of asthma biologics in VigiBase confirmed the presence of well-known adverse effects such as general disorders, injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, headache and hypersensitivity, while some others (e.g. asthma reactivation or therapeutic failure) could be ascribed to the indication of use. Moreover, the analysis of signals of disproportionate reporting suggests the presence of malignancies, effects on the cardiovascular system, alopecia and autoimmune conditions, requiring further assessment and investigation.",

Acyclovir (ACV) and ganciclovir (GCV), most frequently used as anti-herpes drugs, are recommended for prophylaxis and therapy in human BV infection. In this study, we examined the property of BV thymidine kinase (TK) against anti-herpes drugs using a recombinant herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) carrying BV TK gene. We found that HSV-1 carrying BV TK was similarly sensitive to GCV as HSV-1 carrying varicella zoster virus TK. In addition, we demonstrated that BV TK was not mutated in the GCV- and ACV-resistant HSV-1 carrying BV TK, suggesting that ACV- or GCV-resistant BV might be rare during treatment with these antiviral drugs. These data can provide a new insight into the properties of BV TK in terms of the development of drug resistance.",

The early clinical similarity of MPXV to common ailments like the flu and cold, coupled with the resemblances of its progressing rash to other infections, underscores the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis. Among the infections, smallpox is clinically closest to MPXV, and rashes similar to MPXV stages also appear in syphilis and varicella zoster. A comprehensive review of MPXV, herpes, and syphilis was carried out, including structural and morphological features, origins, transmission modes, and computational studies. PubMed literature search on MPXV, using MeSH key terms, yielded 1904 results, with the analysis revealing prominent links to sexually transmitted diseases. More in-depth exploration of MPXV, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), and Syphilis revealed further disease interconnections and geographical correlations. These findings emphasize the need for a holistic understanding of these interconnected infectious agents for better control and management.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review:To analyze the efficacy and safety of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in the treatment of pediatric AD. Recent findings:Adolescents with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis (AD) need systemic therapies, as stated several recent practice guidelines. (JAKi) have shown their efficacy in the treatment of adult AD, however, there is a lack of information concerning efficacy and safety of their use in pediatric AD. We found that the JAKi's abrocitinib (ABRO), baricitinib (BARI), and upadacitinib (UPA), are all an effective treatment option with a very fast onset of action for adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD. BARI was not effective in children between 2 and 10 years with moderate-to-severe AD. Fortunately, major safety issues with JAKi in adolescents with AD have not been documented in the trials, so far, contrasting with the reports in adults with AD, where these events have very rarely occurred. There are some reports of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in adolescents on JAKi, but it is not a major safety concern. Acne is a relatively common AE with UPA in adolescents; however, it is responsive to standard treatment. This review will help the clinician to choose among the JAKi according to the needs and clinical features of patients with moderate and severe AD. In the following years, with the advent of new biologicals and JAKi, these therapies will fall into place in each phase of the evolution of patients with AD.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Opportunistic infections (OIs) are more common and severe among people with suppressed immunity like those living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). This study aimed to assess the prevalence of OIs and associated factors among PLWH attending antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Gedeo zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods:A facility based retrospective cohort study was conducted from April to June 2018 among PLWH attending ART clinics in Gedeo zone, Ethiopia from November 2016 - November 2017. A simple random sampling method was used to select the both paper based and electronic study participants' charts. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis for variables statistically significant at 95% confidence interval under bivariable logistic regression analysis, and significance was declared at P < 0.05. Results:a total of 266 PLWH attended the selected ART clinics of Gedeo zone during the one year period were participated in the current study. The majority 104(39.1%) were within the age group 30-39, 106(60.2%) male, 184(69.2%) married, and 167(62.9%) urban residents. The study revealed the prevalence of OIs was 113(42.5%) with oral candidiasis 28(24.5%) the most prevalent followed by pulmonary tuberculosis 22(19.5%) and herpes zoster 15(13.4%). Further, study participants with ambulatory [AOR = 2.40(95% CI: 1.14, 5.03)], and bedridden [AOR = 3.27(95% CI:1.64, 6.52)] working functional status; with lower CD4 count: less than 200cells/mm3[AOR = 9.14(95% CI: 2.75, 30.39)], 200-350cells/mm3[AOR = 9.45(95% CI: 2.70,33.06)], 351-500cells/mm3[AOR = 5.76(95% CI: 1.71, 19.39)]; being poor in ART adherence level [AOR = 10.05(95% CI: 4.31,23.46)]; being in stage III/IV WHO clinical stage of HIV/AIDS [AOR = 2.72(95% CI: 1.42, 5.20)]; and being chewing khat [AOR = 2.84(95% CI: 1.21, 6.65)] were found positively predicting the occurrence of OIs. Conclusion:This study speckled a high prevalence of OIs with several predicting factors. Therefore, the study acmes there should be interventional means which tackles the higher prevalence of OIs with focus to the predicting factors like lower CD4 count level, less/bedridden working functional status, poor ART adherence level, advanced stage of HIV/AIDS stage and chewing khat.",

        "abstract": "Background:Upadacitinib is an oral, selective Janus kinase inhibitor. Aim:To assess the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis following 16-week extended induction therapy, and 52-week maintenance therapy in patients achieving clinical response after 16-week extended induction therapy METHODS: Patients without clinical response to 8 weeks' upadacitinib 45 mg once daily induction therapy in two induction trials were eligible for an additional 8 weeks of therapy. Patients achieving clinical response at Week 16 were subsequently re-randomised (1:1) to upadacitinib 15 or 30 mg once daily for 52-week maintenance therapy. Efficacy was assessed at induction Week 16 (integrated) and maintenance Week 52; safety was assessed throughout. Results:Overall, 127/663 (19.2%) patients did not achieve clinical response to upadacitinib 45 mg at Week 8 and received an additional 8 weeks of therapy; 75/127 (59.1%) subsequently achieved clinical response at Week 16 and entered the maintenance trial. At Week 52, 26.5% of patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg, and 43.6% receiving 30 mg, achieved clinical remission; efficacy was observed across all other endpoints with both doses. Herpes zoster rates increased with longer duration (16 weeks) of exposure to upadacitinib 45 mg during induction compared with the same population during the first 8 weeks. No other new safety signals were observed, and results are otherwise consistent with the known safety profile of upadacitinib. Conclusions:Patients without clinical response after 8 weeks' upadacitinib 45 mg induction therapy, may benefit from an additional 8 weeks of therapy.

        "abstract": "Background and aims:While filgotinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1 preferential inhibitor, is approved for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), real-world studies assessing its short- and long-term efficacy and safety are limited. Methods:This is a multicenter, retrospective study of UC patients who started filgotinib between March 2022 and September 2023. The primary outcome was clinical remission, defined as a partial Mayo score ≤1 with a rectal bleeding score of 0, or Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) ≤2 with a blood-in-stool score of 0. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, corticosteroid-free remission, and endoscopic improvement. Outcomes were assessed at 10, 26, and 58 weeks based on patients with available follow-up. Adverse events were evaluated. Results:We identified 238 UC patients and 54% had prior exposure to biologics/JAK inhibitors. The median baseline partial Mayo score and SCCAI were 5 (IQR 3-6) and 4 (IQR 2-7). Clinical remission rates based on per-protocol analysis at 10, 26, and 58 weeks were 47% (70/149), 55.8% (48/86), and 64.6% (31/48), respectively. At a median follow-up of 28 weeks (IQR 10-54) with a discontinuation rate of 39%, the rates of clinical remission, clinical response, corticosteroid-free remission, and endoscopic improvement were 39.9% (81/203), 54.7% (111/203), and 36.5% (74/203), and 43.5% (10/23), respectively. These rates were comparable between biologic/JAK inhibitor-naïve and -experienced patients. While three patients (1.3%) developed herpes zoster infection, no cases of thrombosis or death were reported. Conclusions:Real-world data demonstrate favourable clinical and safety outcomes of filgotinib for UC.",

        "abstract": "Background:Two phase 3 trials, POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2, previously established the efficacy and overall safety of deucravacitinib, an oral, selective, allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, in plaque psoriasis. Objectives:To further assess the safety of deucravacitinib over 52 weeks in the pooled population from these two trials. Methods:Pooled safety data were evaluated from PSO-1 and PSO-2 in which patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were randomized 1:2:1 to receive oral placebo, deucravacitinib or apremilast. Results:A total of 1683 patients were included in the pooled analysis. Adverse event (AE) incidence rates were similar in each treatment group, serious AEs were low and balanced across groups, and discontinuation rates were lower with deucravacitinib versus placebo or apremilast. No new safety signals emerged with longer deucravacitinib treatment. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of AEs of interest with placebo, deucravacitinib and apremilast, respectively, were as follows: serious infections (0.8/100 person-years [PY], 1.7/100 PY, and 1.8/100 PY), major adverse cardiovascular events (1.2/100 PY, 0.3/100 PY, and 0.9/100 PY), venous thromboembolic events (0, 0.2/100 PY, and 0), malignancies (0, 1.0/100 PY and 0.9/100 PY), herpes zoster (0.4/100 PY, 0.8/100 PY, and 0), acne (0.4/100 PY, 2.9/100 PY, and 0) and folliculitis (0, 2.8/100 PY, and 0.9/100 PY). No clinically meaningful changes from baseline in mean levels, or shifts from baseline to CTCAE grade ≥3 abnormalities, were reported in laboratory parameters with deucravacitinib. Conclusions:Deucravacitinib was well-tolerated with acceptable safety over 52 weeks in patients with psoriasis.",

        "abstract": "Background:Limited real-world data are available on upadacitinib drug survival in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).Objectives:To investigate upadacitinib drug survival, and the reasons and predictors of drug discontinuation in AD patients.Methods:All consecutive patients aged 18-75 years, affected by moderate-to-severe AD, and treated with upadacitinib for more than 1 month at dermatological clinics were included during November 2020-August 2023. Upadacitinib survival was investigated through Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the predictors through multivariable logistic regression analysis.Results:Overall, 325 adult AD patients (mean (SD) age, 38.6(15.6) years) had a 1-year and 1.5-year upadacitinib drug survival of 91.5% and 80.2%, respectively. The main reasons for drug discontinuation (25/325, 7.7%) were adverse events (4.9%), including cutaneous or infectious diseases (1.5%), such as acne and herpes zoster; blood test changes (1.2%), including hypercholesterolemia, creatine phosphokinase or liver enzyme elevation, and lymphopenia; urinary or respiratory infections (0.9%); deep venous thrombosis (0.3%); malignancies (0.3%); loss of consciousness (0.3%); and arthralgias (0.3%); followed by ineffectiveness (0.6%). No specific characteristic was significantly associated with an increased risk of upadacitinib discontinuation.Conclusions:Our findings show that upadacitinib was effective in moderate-to-severe AD after more than 1 year of continuous treatment but point to the need for clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:We investigated the effectiveness and safety of filgotinib in a real-life multicentre cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Methods:RA patients were evaluated at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks and were stratified based on previous treatments as biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD)-naive and bDMARD-insufficient responders (IR). Concomitant usage of methotrexate (MTX) and oral glucocorticoids (GC) was recorded. At each timepoint we recorded disease activity, laboratory parameters and adverse events. Results:126 patients were enrolled. 15.8% were bDMARD-naive (G0), while 84% were bDMARD-IR (G1). In G0, 45% of patients were in monotherapy (G2) and 55% were taken MTX (G3). In G1, 50% of patients were in monotherapy (G4) and 50% used MTX (G5).A significant reduction in all parameters at 12 weeks was observed; in the extension to 24 weeks the significant reduction was maintained for patient global assessment (PGA), examiner global assessment (EGA), visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, VAS fatigue, disease activity score (DAS)28- C-reactive protein (CRP) and CRP values. Filgotinib in monotherapy showed better outcomes in bDMARD-naive patients, with significant differences for patient reported outcomes (PROs) and DAS28-CRP. At 12 weeks, low disease activity (LDA) and remission were achieved in a percentage of 37.2 % and 10.7 % by simplified disease activity index (SDAI), 42.6 % and 5.7 % by clinical disease activity index (CDAI), 26.8 % and 25.2 % by DAS28-CRP, respectively. A significant decrease in steroid dose was evidenced in all patients. We observed a major adverse cardiovascular event in one patient and an increase in transaminase in another. No infections from Herpes Zoster were reported. Conclusions:Our real-world data confirm the effectiveness and safety of filgotinib in the management of RA, especially in bDMARD-naive patients.",

However, the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in keratitis is low (25%) compared with that of mucocutaneous disease (75%). We developed an educational intervention aimed at improving the diagnostic yield of PCR. Methods:The medical records of keratitis cases seen at the emergency department of a London tertiary ophthalmic referral hospital over two distinct periods, before and after an educational program on swab technique, were reviewed retrospectively. Results:A total of 252 HSV cases were included. Increases in the laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of HSV-1 were observed, in both first presentations (11.1%-57.7%) and recurrent cases (20%-57.6%). The rate of positive HSV-1 PCR in eyes with an epithelial defect increased from 19% pre-intervention to 62% post intervention. Notably, 3% were positive for varicella zoster virus DNA, and there was a single case ofAcanthamoebakeratitis. Conclusion:Our results suggest that, with proper swabbing technique, PCR may be more sensitive than previously reported.",

        "abstract": "Background:Observational studies have suggested that herpes virus infections increase the risk of allograft dysfunction after tissue and organ transplantation, but it is still unclear whether this association is causal. The aim of this study was to assess the causal relationship between four herpes virus infections and allograft dysfunction. Methods:We used two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causality between four herpes virus infections - cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) - and allograft dysfunction after tissue and organ transplantation. Based on summary data extracted from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we chose eligible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables. The Inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the main analysis method, supplemented by Weighted median and MR-Egger analyses. The MR-PRESSO test, MR-Egger intercept test, heterogeneity test, leave-one-out analysis and funnel plot were used to analyze the sensitivity of MR results. Results:We found EBV early antigen-D (EA-D) antibody levels and shingles were the only two variables associated with an increased risk of allograft dysfunction. No evidence of allograft dysfunction increasing the risk of the four herpes virus infections was observed. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our results. Conclusions:Our results suggest that EBV and VZV are involved in graft rejection or dysfunction.

        "abstract": "Previous exposure to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly associated with the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). By contrast, past cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may have no association, or be negatively associated with MS. This study aimed to investigate the associations of herpesvirus infections with MS in an Italian population. Serum samples (n= 200) from Italian people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) classified as the relapsing-and-remitting clinical phenotype and (n= 137) healthy controls (HCs) were obtained from the CRESM Biobank, Orbassano, Italy. Both PwMS and HCs samples were selected according to age group (20-39 years, and 40 or more years) and sex. EBV virus capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, EBV nucleic acid-1 antigen (EBNA-1) IgG, CMV IgG, herpes simplex virus (HSV) IgG, and varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG testing was undertaken using commercial ELISAs. EBV VCA IgG and EBNA-1 IgG seroprevalences were 100% in PwMS and 93.4% and 92.4%, respectively, in HCs. EBV VCA IgG and EBNA-1 IgG levels were higher (p< 0.001) in PwMS compared with HCs. For PwMS, the EBNA-1 IgG levels decreased with age, particularly in females. The CMV IgG seroprevalence was 58.7% in PwMS and 62.9% in HCs. CMV IgG seroprevalence increased with age. The HSV IgG seroprevalence was 71.2% in PwMS and 70.8% in HCs. HSV IgG levels were lower (p= 0.0005) in PwMS compared with HCs. VZV IgG seroprevalence was 97.5% in PwMS and 98.5% in HCs. In the population studied, several herpesvirus infections markers may have been influenced by the age and sex of the groups studied. The lack of a negative association of MS with CMV infection, and the observation of lower levels of HSV IgG in PwMS compared with HCs are findings worthy of further investigation.",

With universal childhood varicella vaccination, which was introduced in 1995, most adults in the United States (US) and Europe are immune. It is estimated that >90% of the antenatal population is seropositive for VZV IgG antibody and therefore immune to infection. The seronegative patients are at risk of acquiring VZV during pregnancy which is associated with a higher mortality rate due to developing varicella pneumonitis. Possible fetal effects of varicella may also occur and include fetal demise or manifestations of either congenital varicella syndrome (embryopathy) or neonatal varicella (development of chickenpox or disseminated disease) the first 10 days of life), which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "Background:Kaposi Varicelliform Eruptions (KVE), also known as eczema herpeticum, is a rare and potentially life-threatening dermatological condition primarily attributed to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, with less frequent involvement of Coxsackie A16, vaccinia, Varicella Zoster, and smallpox viruses. Typically associated with pre-existing skin diseases, especially atopic dermatitis, KVE predominantly affects children but can manifest in healthy adults. Characterized by painful clusters of vesicles and sores on the skin and mucous membranes, it often masquerades as other dermatological disorders. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used for pain relief and inflammation, though their potential role as KVE triggers remains uncertain. Case report:Here, we present a case of an 18-year-old female with KVE attributed to Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) and successfully treated with oral acyclovir within a week, underscoring the significance of early recognition and intervention. KVE can manifest with systemic symptoms like fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy and may involve multiple organ systems, necessitating possible antibiotic use for complications. Conclusion:This case underscores the importance of prompt KVE identification and consideration of antiviral therapy to enhance patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to elucidate predisposing factors for this rare condition.",

Data source:The review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), under CRD42021274210. The literature search was performed in databases: PubMed, Virtual Health Library/ Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (VHL/BIREME), Scopus, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Cochrane, ProQuest, and EBSCOhost. The search was carried out from August to October 2021 and updated in December 2022, respecting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The selection sequence was: 1) Duplicate title removal; 2) Examination of titles and abstracts; 3) Full-text retrieval of potentially relevant reports; and 4) Evaluation of the full text according to eligibility criteria by two independent authors. Inclusion criteria considered randomized and non-randomized control trials, longitudinal, cross-sectional, and peer-reviewed studies in humans, published in English, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, with newborns up to 28 days old who had congenital neuroinfections by toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex (TORCH), and others such as Treponema pallidum, Zika, parvovirus B-19, varicella zoster, Epstein-Barr, and SARS-CoV2, diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two evaluators extracted the following information: author, year of publication, nationality, subjects, study type, methods, results, and conclusion. Data synthesis:The most studied pathogen was herpes simplex. Several articles reported only nonspecific initial symptoms, motivating the collection of cerebrospinal fluid and performing PCR for etiological investigation. Conclusions:Molecular methods are effective to detect pathogen genomes in cerebrospinal fluid, which can impact clinical evolution and neurological prognosis. Objetivo::Verificar a utilização e identificar as vantagens dos métodos moleculares para diagnóstico de infecções congênitas no líquido cefalorraquidiano de neonatos. Fontes de dados::A revisão foi registrada na base PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) sob CRD42021274210.

A busca foi feita no período de agosto a outubro de 2021 e atualizada em dezembro de 2022, respeitando as orientações doPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews e Meta-Analyises(PRISMA). A sequência da seleção dos estudos foi: 1) Remoção de duplicatas; 2) Exame de títulos e resumos; 3) Recuperação dos textos completos potencialmente relevantes; e 4) Avaliação do texto completo conforme critérios de elegibilidade por dois autores independentes. O critério de inclusão considerou ensaios clínicos randomizados e não randomizados, estudos longitudinais, transversais, revisados por pares, estudos em humanos, publicados em inglês, espanhol, italiano e português, com recém-nascidos de até 28 dias que sofreram neuroinfecções congênitas pelos agentes toxoplasmose, rubéola, citomegalovírus, herpes simples (TORCH), e outros comoTreponema pallidum, Zika, parvovírus B-19, varicela zoster, Epstein-Barr, e SARS-CoV-2, diagnosticadas por reação em cadeia de polimerase (PCR). Dois avaliadores extraíram as seguintes informações: autor, ano de publicação, nacionalidade, sujeitos, tipo de estudo, métodos, resultados e conclusão. Síntese dos dados::O patógeno mais estudado foi Herpes Simples. Muitos artigos relataram somente sintomas iniciais inespecíficos, motivando a coleta de líquido cefalorraquidiano e realização da PCR para investigação etiológica.

The pharmacological effects ofC. nutansare influenced by the presence of terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic acids, saponins, glycosides, steroids and tannins. This review focused on the phytochemical makeup, which varies geographically and is a subject of scarcely existing knowledge.C. nutansserved as the primary search term, while the keywords \"phytochemicals\", \"chemical component\" and \"phytochemistry\" were used to search the literature in the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases. The articles pertinent to the subject were found and reviewed. The phytochemical composition ofC. nutansvaried depending on the region it was cultivated in, and was influenced by the environmental conditions, genetics, air temperature and postharvest practices.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To do the etiological analysis of ocular herps virus infection, revealing the pathogen species and the distribution of different virus types within the eye. Methods:Samples were collected from 2017 to 2021 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Peking University Third Hospital and tested using real-time PCR for common ocular viruses: herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The pathogenesis of the different viruses was classified and analyzed according to the site of infection. Results:Viral PCR detections were performed on 3627 samples collected over the 5-years and 649 (17.89%) samples contained one or more of the viruses tested. The overall detection rate of CMV was highest at 9.93%. Of all sample types, aqueous humor was the most common (1752 cases), of which 340 were positive (19.41% positive rate). Corneal samples were the next most common, with 1481 cases and 250 positive results (16.88% positive rate). CMV positivity was higher in aqueous humor and corneal samples than other viruses; vitreous body had the highest positive rate at 36.36% (20/55), among which 18 cases were VZV positive. Conclusions:Distribution of virus types differed among infection sites, with CMV the most common virus type detected in the cornea and aqueous humor, while VZV was the most common virus detected in the vitreous body.",

        "title": "Long-term safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: 5-year data from the phase 3, randomised SELECT-COMPARE study",
        "abstract": "Objectives:To assess the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib versus adalimumab from SELECT-COMPARE over 5 years. Methods:Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to methotrexate were randomised to receive upadacitinib 15 mg once daily, placebo or adalimumab 40 mg every other week, all with concomitant methotrexate. By week 26, patients with insufficient response to randomised treatment were rescued; patients remaining on placebo switched to upadacitinib. Patients completing the 48-week double-blind period could enter a long-term extension. Safety and efficacy were assessed through week 264, with radiographic progression analysed through week 192. Safety was assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Efficacy was analysed by randomised group (non-responder imputation (NRI)) or treatment sequence (as observed). Results:Rates of TEAEs were generally similar with upadacitinib versus adalimumab, although numerically higher rates of herpes zoster, lymphopenia, creatine phosphokinase elevation, hepatic disorder and non-melanoma skin cancer were reported with upadacitinib. Numerically greater proportions of patients randomised to upadacitinib versus adalimumab achieved clinical responses (NRI); Clinical Disease Activity Index remission (≤2.8) and Disease Activity Score based on C reactive protein <2.6 were achieved by 24.6% vs 18.7% (nominal p=0.042) and 31.8% vs 23.2% (nominal p=0.006), respectively. Radiographic progression was numerically lower with continuous upadacitinib versus adalimumab at week 192. Conclusion:The safety profile of upadacitinib through 5 years was consistent with the known safety profile of upadacitinib, with no new safety risks. Clinical responses were numerically higher with upadacitinib versus adalimumab at 5 years. Upadacitinib demonstrates a favourable benefit-risk profile for long-term rheumatoid arthritis treatment.

        "abstract": "Background:Real-world data on tofacitinib (TOF) covering a period of more than 1 year for a sufficient number of Asian patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are scarce. Aim:To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of TOF treatment for UC, including clinical issues. Methods:We performed a retrospective single-center observational analysis of 111 UC patients administered TOF at Hyogo Medical University as a tertiary inflammatory bowel disease center. All consecutive UC patients who received TOF between May 2018 and February 2020 were enrolled. Patients were followed up until August 2020. The primary outcome was the clinical response rate at week 8. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission at week 8, cumulative persistence rate of TOF administration, colectomy-free survival, relapse after tapering of TOF and predictors of clinical response at week 8 and week 48. Results:The clinical response and remission rates were 66.3% and 50.5% at week 8, and 47.1% and 43.5% at week 48, respectively. The overall cumulative clinical remission rate was 61.7% at week 48 and history of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) agents use had no influence (P= 0.25). The cumulative TOF persistence rate at week 48 was significantly lower in patients without clinical remission than in those with remission at week 8 (30.9%vs88.1%;P< 0.001). Baseline partial Mayo Score was significantly lower in respondersvsnon-responders at week 8 (odds ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.82,P= 0.001). Relapse occurred in 45.7% of patients after TOF tapering, and 85.7% of patients responded within 4 wk after re-increase. All 6 patients with herpes zoster (HZ) developed the infection after achieving remission by TOF. Conclusion:TOF was more effective in UC patients with mild activity at baseline and its efficacy was not affected by previous treatment with anti-TNF-α agents. Most relapsed patients responded again after re-increase of TOF and nearly half relapsed after tapering off TOF. Special attention is needed for tapering and HZ.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib over 5 years among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a long-term extension (LTE) of the SELECT-BEYOND phase 3 trial. Methods:Patients refractory to ≥1 biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) received upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg once daily or placebo, in combination with background conventional synthetic DMARD(s). At week 12, patients randomised to placebo were switched to upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg. All patients who completed the week 24 visit could enter the LTE for up to 5 years. Efficacy was analysed as observed and by non-responder imputation through week 260. Treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 patient-years were summarised over 5 years. Results:Of the 498 patients randomised, 418 (84%) completed week 24 and entered the LTE. Of those who remained in the trial (n=80, upadacitinib 15 mg; n=81, upadacitinib 30 mg), 36%/36% and 81%/77% randomised to upadacitinib 15/30 mg were in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission or low disease activity at week 260, respectively (as observed). Approximately 47% of all patients who began in high disease activity demonstrated a CDAI improvement >12 at week 260 with upadacitinib 15/30 mg. Functional and pain-related outcomes also showed comparable improvements with both doses. Numerically higher rates of anaemia, herpes zoster and creatine phosphokinase elevation were observed with upadacitinib 30 mg vs 15 mg. No new safety issues were identified. Conclusions:Upadacitinib 15/30 mg continued to be effective in treating clinical and functional outcomes in patients with RA. The safety profile observed over 5 years was consistent with earlier study-specific and integrated assessments of upadacitinib treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background/aim:The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the contraindications, special warnings, and boxed warnings with the aim to establish a framework to create a prescription safety checklist for a class of drugs or disease indication. This study covers biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs). Methods:We identified contraindications, boxed warnings, and special warnings provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study included b/tsDMARDs approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) within the drug-classes anti-CD20, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-1 inhibitors (IL-1i), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA) 4, interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i), interleukin 6 receptor inhibitors (IL-6Ri), Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors (PDE4i), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), and interleukin-23 inhibitors (IL-23i). Results:All drug classes, except PDE4i, had contraindications and/or warnings related to infections, including tuberculosis. A warning about herpes zoster was listed for anti-CD20, IL-1i, IL-6Ri, and JAKi, while a warning about hepatitis reactivation was listed for anti-CD20, TNFi, IL-1i, CTLA4-Ig, IL-6Ri, and JAKi. Malignancy risk was mentioned for all drug classes except PDE4i, IL-17i, and IL-23i. Other warnings included demyelinating disease (TNFi, CTLA4-Ig, and IL-6Ri), heart failure (anti-CD20 and TNFi), major adverse cardiac events (JAKi and IL-12/23) and venous thromboembolism (JAKi), hyperlipidemia (IL-6Ri and JAKi), liver impairment (TNFi, IL-1i, IL-6Ri, and JAKi), kidney impairment (IL-1i, JAKi, and PDE4i), inflammatory bowel disease (IL-17i), gastrointestinal perforation (IL-6Ri, JAKi), cytopenia (anti-CD20, TNFi, IL-1i, IL-6Ri, JAKi), and depression (PDE4i). Contraindications and warnings appeared to increase with the passage of time since the drug's approval. Conclusion:This review provides an overview to establish the framework to create an easily accessible and actionable prescription safety checklist from individual medical product prescription information provided by regulatory medical authorities.",

        "abstract": "Background:Tofacitinib has recently been approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults, yet pediatric data are limited. This international multicenter study describes the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in pediatric UC. Methods:This is a retrospective review of children diagnosed with UC treated with tofacitinib from 16 pediatric centers internationally. The primary outcome was week 8 corticosteroid-free clinical remission (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index <10). Secondary outcomes were clinical response (≥20-point decrease in Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index) at week 8, corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 24, and colectomy rate and adverse safety events through to last follow-up. The primary outcome was calculated by the intention-to-treat principle. Results:We included 101 children with a mean age at diagnosis of 12.8 ± 2.8 years and a median disease duration of 20 months (interquartile range [IQR], 10-39 months). All had treatment failure with at least 1 biologic agent, and 36 (36%) had treatment failure with 3 agents. Median follow-up was 24 weeks (IQR, 16-54 weeks). Sixteen (16%) children achieved corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 8, and an additional 30 (30%) demonstrated clinical response. Twenty (23%) of 88 children achieved corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 24. A total of 25 (25%) children underwent colectomy by median 86 days (IQR, 36-130 days). No serious drug-related adverse events were reported; there was 1 case of herpes zoster and 2 cases of minor blood test perturbations. Conclusions:In this largest real-life pediatric cohort to date, tofacitinib was effective in at least 16% of patients with highly refractory UC by week 8. Adverse events were minor and largely consistent with adult data.",

        "abstract": "Background:Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). This analysis assessed the impact of cigarette smoking on tofacitinib efficacy and safety in the UC clinical program. Methods:Efficacy endpoints and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated by smoking status (ever smokers [current and ex-smokers] and never smokers) in the phase (P)2 induction study (baseline demographics and safety only), P3 studies (OCTAVE Induction 1&2, OCTAVE Sustain, OCTAVE Open), and P3/4b RIVETING study. Results:This post hoc analysis included 1156 patients (ever smokers,n= 416 [36.0%; current smokers,n= 59 (5.1%); ex-smokers,n= 357 (30.9%)]; never smokers,n= 740 [64.0%]; median [range] treatment duration 654 [1-2712] and 615.5 [1-2850] days, respectively). Similar proportions of ever smokers and never smokers achieved efficacy endpoints. AEs were reported in 88.7% of ever smokers and 83.8% of never smokers. Overall, 60.6% of ever smokers had an infection (serious infections, 5.5%; herpes zoster [nonserious and serious], 10.8%;Clostridioides difficileinfection, 12.0%; lower respiratory tract infection, 19.5%: corresponding values among never smokers were 53.1%, 3.9%, 6.8%, 8.5%, and 11.4%). Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in 1.0% of ever smokers and 0.7% of never smokers and thromboembolism events (venous and arterial) in 1.0% of ever smokers and 0.9% never smokers. Deaths, malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]), and NMSC occurred infrequently in ever smokers (0.5%, 2.5%, and 3.7%, respectively) and never smokers (0.1%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively). Colorectal cancer was reported in 0.6% of never smokers; no cases occurred in ever smokers. Conclusions:Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib were generally similar in ever smokers and never smokers. Overall, serious AEs and, as expected, infections were more frequent in ever smokers versus never smokers. This may inform treatment selection and monitoring strategies.

        "abstract": "Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is an acute form of encephalitis that can lead to poor neurological outcomes. Although the exact pathogenesis of HSE remains elusive, recent reports suggest a significant role for postinfectious immune-inflammatory processes in the central nervous system (CNS). This study aimed to clarify the association between CNS autoimmune responses and clinical presentation in patients with HSE, focusing on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics, particularly the IgG index. We retrospectively analyzed 176 consecutive patients suspected of having aseptic meningitis /encephalitis for chronological changes in CSF findings and clinical presentations. These patients underwent PCR screening for herpesviruses (HV) in their CSF. We identified seven patients positive for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), 20 patients positive for varicella-zoster virus, and 17 patients who met the criteria for aseptic meningitis but were PCR-negative for HV. Patients in the HSV-1-positive group exhibited a significant increase in the IgG index at the time of PCR-negative conversion compared with on admission (p = 0.0156), while such a change was not observed in the other two groups. Additionally, all patients in the HSV-1-positive group tested negative for anti-neural autoantibodies in CSF and serum samples collected approximately 3 weeks after onset. This study, therefore, highlights that CSF IgG index elevation occurs even after PCR-confirmed HSV-1 clearance, which might indicate immunopathogenesis that is independent of antibody-mediated mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "The Japanese Research Group for Neuro-infectious Diseases was founded in August 1996, and by 2004 it had evolved into the Japanese Society for Neuro-infectious Diseases. The Society focuses on neuroinfectious conditions (e.g., encephalitis/encephalopathy, myelitis, and meningitis), providing a venue for academic presentations and exchanges. Clinical guidelines for major neurological infectious diseases are also published by the Society, in order to meet the social demands of each era. Although the threat of herpes simplex encephalitis has declined due to acyclovir's introduction, the frequency of encephalitis or peripheral neuropathy caused by varicella-zoster virus is increasing. In Japan, prion disease, human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy (HAM), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are designated as intractable diseases. The incidence of prion disease is 1.8/1,000,000 individuals, with the sporadic type accounting for 80%. Prion disease is fatal, and effective medications are awaited. HAM's prevalence is ~3/100,000 individuals, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:2-3. HAM is common in western Japan, including Kyushu and Okinawa. The prevalence of PML is rising with the spread of both immunosuppressive therapy for transplantation and treatment for multiple sclerosis. From late 2019 through 2020, the world faced a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to virus mutations, and the threat of new mutations persists. Close attention should be paid to the emergence of new neurological infections that could arise from abnormal weather patterns and/or a decline in immune function due to aging.",

Since amenamevir is already approved for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV in Japan and pritelivir has received breakthrough therapy status for the treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV infections in immunocompromised patients, the target has sparked interest in me-too approaches. Here, we describe the attempt to improve nervous tissue penetration in Phaeno Therapeutics drug candidate HN0037 to target the latent reservoir of HSV by installing less polar moieties, mainly a difluorophenyl instead of a pyridyl group, and replacing the primary sulfonamide with a methyl sulfoximine moiety. However, all obtained stereoisomers exhibited a weaker inhibitory activity on HSV-1 and HSV-2.",

        "abstract": "Background:Since the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Wuhan, China in late 2019, concomitant infections with Herpesviridae were documented that were presented from simple skin manifestations to severe life-threatening conditions that may lead to mortality. In this systematic review, we have included studies conducted in different parts of the world to find out the association of clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection and concomitant Herpesviridae infection. Methods:A comprehensive search was conducted in electronic databases including Medline through PubMed, Cochrane database, Scopus and Web of science (core collection). Two review authors independently screened the articles and extracted data. The Risk of bias assessment was done by using RoBANS tool. Results:A total of 919 studies were retrieved and 19 studies were included having data of 539 patients who were infected with both COVID-19 and Herpesviridae. Herpes Simplex-1, Varicella Zoster, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and Human Herpes Virus-6 were the detected viruses in the included studies. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation was the most detected concomitant infection. In case of reactivation with more than one Herpes virus mortality among patients were detected along with single viral infection in some studies. Significant association was noted in dosage and usage of steroid and Herpesviridae reactivation in COVID-19 patients. Blood markers such as D-dimer, CRP along with length of stay in the ICU and usage of invasive mechanical ventilation were found to be the significantly associated markers. Conclusion:Findings from this study will aid clinicians to assess and treat COVID-19 cases with co-infections.",

        "abstract": "Background:Aseptic meningitis comprises meningeal inflammation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis without positive Gram stain and culture. Regional differences exist in the prevalence of viral etiologies of aseptic meningitis. We aimed to assess the etiologies of aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent adults, focusing on herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Methods:This study retrospectively analyzed immunocompetent adults diagnosed with meningitis at a Korean tertiary care hospital from 2016 to 2018. Aseptic meningitis was defined through clinical and CSF analysis. We compared clinical and laboratory characteristics across viral etiologies and investigated predictors of HSV-2 meningitis. Results:A total of 98 patients (46.9% female) with aseptic meningitis were finally enrolled. The etiologies of aseptic meningitis were identified in 62 patients (63.3%), including enterovirus (28.5%), HSV-2 (16.3%), and varicella zoster virus (VZV, 15.3%). HSV-2 showed female predominance, with shorter admission times with longer hospital stays and a recurrent meningitis history. Compared to other viral etiologies, HSV-2 showed higher CSF white blood cell (WBC) counts and protein levels but lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. A random forest model identified previous meningitis history and serum CRP level as key predictors of HSV-2 meningitis. Conclusions:This study provides insights into the etiologies of aseptic meningitis in a specific Korean region, identifying HSV-2 as a notable cause. The prediction model suggested that the clinical history of previous meningitis and serum CRP level may guide clinical assessment of meningitis.",

        "abstract": "Background:Atopic conditions are known to be associated with viral and bacterial infections. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the effects of atopic conditions on the severity and recurrence of ocular infections including herpes simplex virus (HSV). Methods:This study was performed on 474 consecutive patients with infectious keratitis caused by bacteria, fungus, acanthamoeba, HSV, or varicella-zoster virus. The relationships between the atopic condition and specific infectious pathogens and HSV were determined using real-time PCR. Results:Our findings showed that atopic dermatitis (AD) was significantly associated with the incidence of HSV keratitis (odds ratio (OR), 10.2; P = 0.000). Other associations with AD were observed only with bacteria in an adverse manner. HSV proliferation in the lesions of patients with HSV keratitis whose AD was associated with non-infectious atopic blepharitis were significantly greater by 145-folds (P = 0.000). The presence of asthma or allergic rhinitis also increased the HSV DNA copy numbers. A recurrence of HSV keratitis was observed in 70 patients (43.2 %), and mean time to recurrence was 1647 days. Cox proportional hazard model indicated that the epithelial type of HSV recurrence but not the stromal type was associated with atopic conditions especially with AD. The factors significantly associated with a recurrence was AD associated with non-infectious atopic blepharitis (HR: 6.11, P = 0.000) and asthma (HR: 3.03, P = 0.025). Conclusions:Atopic conditions, especially AD with atopic blepharitis, are significantly associated with the development, increased proliferation, and shorter time to a recurrence on HSV keratitis.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:To compare the safety of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) with that of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and determine drug persistence among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). Methods:We analysed data from patients included in BIOBADASER 3.0 and treated with JAKi or TNFi from 2015 to 2023 and estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of adverse events and persistence. Results:A total of 6826 patients were included. Of these, 52% had RA, 25% psoriatic arthritis and 23% axial SpA. Treatment was with TNFi in 86%. The mean duration of treatment was 2.2±2.0 years with TNFi versus 1.8±1.5 with JAKi. JAKis were prescribed in older patients with longer term disease, greater comorbidity and later treatment lines and more frequently as monotherapy. The IRR of all infections and gastrointestinal events was higher among patients with RA treated with JAKi. Drug persistence at 1, 2 and 3 years was 69%, 55% and 45% for TNFi and 68%, 54% and 45% for JAKi. Multivariate regression models showed a lower probability of discontinuation for JAKi (HR=0.85; 95% CI 0.78-0.92) and concomitant conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (HR=0.90; 95% CI 0.84-0.96). The risk of discontinuation increased with glucocorticoids, comorbidities, greater disease activity and later treatment lines. Conclusions:Infections, herpes zoster and gastrointestinal adverse events in patients with RA tended to be more frequent with JAKi. However, prognosis was poor in patients receiving JAKi. Persistence was similar for TNFi and JAKi, although factors associated with discontinuation differed by diagnostic group.",

        "abstract": "Background:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib monotherapy versus methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy over 5 years among MTX-naïve patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the long-term extension (LTE) of the phase 3 SELECT-EARLY trial. Methods:Patients were randomized to receive upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg or MTX. Patients who did not achieve CDAI remission and had < 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts at week 26 received rescue therapy (addition of MTX in the upadacitinib group and addition of upadacitinib in the MTX group). Efficacy assessments were evaluated over 5 years and are reported as observed (AO) for patients who received continuous monotherapy with upadacitinib 15/30 mg or MTX and by randomized group applying non-responder imputation (NRI). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) per 100 patient-years were summarized over 5 years. Results:Of 945 patients randomized and treated, 775 (82%) completed week 48 and entered the LTE on study drug. Higher proportions of patients consistently achieved disease activity targets over 5 years with upadacitinib than MTX. In AO analyses, 53%/59% of patients attained CDAI remission with upadacitinib 15/30 mg versus 43% with MTX at week 260. NRI analyses showed better CDAI, DAS28(CRP), and ACR responses with upadacitinib relative to MTX at week 260 (all comparisons, nominal P < .001). Upadacitinib treatment also resulted in numerically greater inhibition of structural joint progression through week 260 compared to MTX. Most TEAEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher in patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg. Rates of serious infections, herpes zoster, creatine phosphokinase elevation, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and neutropenia were numerically higher with upadacitinib than MTX. The observed safety profile of upadacitinib over 5 years was consistent with earlier trial results and integrated phase 3 safety analyses. Conclusions:Upadacitinib showed better clinical responses versus MTX in patients with RA throughout the 5-year trial. Higher rates of several AEs were observed with upadacitinib, especially in the 30 mg group, compared to MTX. When used as monotherapy in MTX-naïve patients, the approved upadacitinib 15 mg dose showed better long-term efficacy versus MTX and an overall favorable benefit-risk profile.

        "abstract": "Background:Human tapasin deficiency is reported to cause an autosomal-recessive inborn error of immunity characterized by substantially reduced cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I). Objective:We evaluated the immunologic and clinical consequences of tapasin deficiency. Methods:A novel homozygous variant in TAPBP was identified by means of whole genome sequencing. The expression of tapasin and both subunits of the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Cell surface and intracellular expression of MHC-I were evaluated by flow cytometry. Small interfering RNAs were used for silencing TAPBP expression in HEK293T cells. Results:We identified a deletion in TAPBP (c.312del, p.(K104Nfs∗6)) causing tapasin deficiency in a patient with bronchiectasis and recurrent respiratory tract infections as well as herpes zoster. Besides substantial reduction in TAP1 and TAP2 expression, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from this patient and TAPBP-knockdown HEK293T cells, displayed reduced cell surface expression of MHC-I, while reduction in intracellular expression of MHC-I was less prominent, suggesting a defect in MHC-I trafficking to the plasma membrane. IFN-α improved cell surface expression of MHC-I in tapasin deficient lymphocytes and TAPBP-knockdown HEK293T cells, representing a possible therapeutic approach for tapasin deficiency. Conclusion:Tapasin deficiency is a very rare inborn error of immunity, the pathomechanism and clinical spectrum of which overlaps with TAP deficiencies.",

        "abstract": "Background:The ALLEGRO phase 2a and 2b/3 studies demonstrated that ritlecitinib, an oral JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor, is efficacious at doses of ≥ 30 mg in patients aged ≥ 12 years with alopecia areata (AA). Objective:The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of ritlecitinib in an integrated analysis of four studies in AA. Methods:Two cohorts were analyzed: a placebo-controlled and an all-exposure cohort. Proportions and study size-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) of adverse events (AEs) of interest and laboratory abnormalities are reported. Results:In the placebo-controlled cohort (n = 881; median exposure: 169 days), the proportion of ritlecitinib-treated patients with AEs was 70.2-75.4% across doses versus 69.5% in the placebo group; serious AEs occurred in 0-3.2% versus 1.9% for the placebo. A total of 19 patients permanently discontinued due to AEs (5 while receiving the placebo). In the all-exposure cohort (n = 1294), median ritlecitinib exposure was 624 days [2091.7 total patient-years (PY)]. AEs were reported in 1094 patients (84.5%) and serious AEs in 57 (4.4%); 78 (6.0%) permanently discontinued due to AEs. The most common AEs were headache (17.7%; 11.9/100 PY), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test (15.5%; 9.8/100 PY), and nasopharyngitis (12.4%; 8.2/100 PY). There were two deaths (breast cancer and acute respiratory failure/cardiorespiratory arrest). Proportions (IRs) were < 0.1% (0.05/100 PY) for opportunistic infections, 1.5% (0.9/100 PY) for herpes zoster, 0.5% (0.3/100 PY) for malignancies (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), and 0.2% (0.1/100 PY) for major adverse cardiovascular events. Conclusions:Ritlecitinib is well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile up to 24 months in patients aged ≥ 12 years with AA (video abstract and graphical plain language summary available).

        "title": "Disproportionality Analysis and Characterisation of Medication Errors in EudraVigilance: Exploring Findings on Sexes and Age Groups",
        "abstract": "Background:While medication errors (MEs) have been studied in the European Medicines Agency's EudraVigilance, extensive characterisation and signal detection based on sexes and age groups have not been attempted. Objectives:The aim of this study was to characterise all ME-related individual case safety reports in EudraVigilance and explore notable signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) among sexes and age groups for the 30 most frequently reported drugs. Methods:Individual case safety reports were used from EudraVigilance reported between 2002 and 2021. An ME was defined as any Preferred Term from the narrow Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities®Query. Signals of disproportionate reporting were selected based on a lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval ≥ 1 of the reporting odds ratio, and at least 3 individual case safety reports. Analysed subgroups were female individuals, male individuals, and age groups 0-1 month, 2 months to 2 years, 3-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-64 years, 65-85 years, and >85 years. Heatmaps were utilised as a visual aid to identify striking SDRs. Results:Of the 9,662,345 EudraVigilance reports, 267,262 (2.8%) contained at least one ME, with a total of 300,324 MEs, for 429,554 drugs. The most reported ME was \"Inappropriate schedule of product administration\" (52,646; 17.5%), followed by \"Incorrect dose administered\" (32,379; 10.8%) and \"Wrong technique in product usage process\" (26,831; 8.9%). Individual case safety reports with MEs were most frequently related to female individuals (148,009; 55.4%), most often submitted by healthcare professionals (155,711; 58.3%), originated predominantly from the USA (98,716; 36.9%), followed by France (26,678; 10.0%), and showed a median reported age of 50 years (interquartile range: 26-68). Most ME individual case safety reports (158,991; 59.5%) were associated with a serious health outcome. A total of 847 SDRs were identified, based on the entire EudraVigilance database; for subgroups, the number of SDRs ranged from 84 for the age group 0-1 month to 749 for female individuals. Signals of disproportionate reporting for female individuals and male individuals were very similar. Most MEs were reported for the vaccine against human papillomavirus (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC]: J07BM01; 11,086 MEs, 57% being \"inappropriate schedule of product administration\"), with reporting odds ratios that range from 1.5 to 47.0 among age groups. The SDR for the live-attenuated vaccine against herpes zoster (ATC: J07BK02) had a reporting odds ratio that ranged from 26.6 to 78.1 among all subgroups. Signals of disproportionate reporting for oxycodone (ATC: N02AA05; 847 cases of \"Accidental overdose\", 35%), risperidone (ATC: N05AX08; 469 cases \"Inappropriate schedule of product administration\", 22.3%) and rivaroxaban (ATC: B01AF01; 1,377 cases of \"Incorrect dose administered\", 34.6%) stood out with higher magnitude SDRs for the age group 2 months to 2 years, with an reporting odds ratio range between 8.2 and 10.7, while for the entire EudraVigilance the reporting odds ratio ranged between 1.3 and 1.6 for the same drugs. Conclusions:This exploratory research provides an overview of characterised ME individual case safety reports and SDRs from the EudraVigilance database. Most conspicuous SDRs were identified in specific age groups. Signals of disproportionate reporting, not described in the literature, were found for vaccines, oxycodone, rivaroxaban and risperidone, and may prompt further examination by stakeholders. Top-reported MEs (\"Inappropriate schedule of product administration\", \"Incorrect dose administered\" and \"Wrong technique in product usage process\") emerged as a general priority focus to perform a further root-cause analysis involving healthcare providers, manufacturers and regulatory bodies, to improve the understanding and prevention of MEs.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:To obtain an overview of recent evidence on efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods:This systematic literature research (SLR) investigated the efficacy and safety of conventional synthetic (cs), biological (b) and targeted synthetic (ts) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with PsA. A systematic database search using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL was conducted to identify relevant articles published since the previous update in 2019 until 28 December 2022. Efficacy was assessed in trials while for safety observational data were also considered. Adverse events of special interest were infections (including herpes zoster, influenza and tuberculosis), malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolisms, liver disease, laboratory changes and psychiatric adverse events. No meta-analyses were performed. Results:For efficacy, of 3946 articles screened, 38 articles (30 trials) were analysed. The compounds investigated included csDMARDs (leflunomide, methotrexate), bDMARDs inhibiting IL17 (bimekizumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, izokibep, secukinumab,), IL-23 (guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab), IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) as well as TNF (adalimumab, certolizumab-pegol, etanercept, infliximab, golimumab) and Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) (brepocitinib, deucravacitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib). The compounds investigated were efficacious in improving signs and symptoms of PsA, improving physical functioning and quality of life. For safety, 2055 abstracts were screened, and 24 articles analysed: 15 observational studies and 9 long-term follow-ups of trials, assessing glucocorticoids, TNFi, IL-17i, JAKi, IL-12/23i and PDE4i (apremilast). Safety indicators were generally coherent with the previous SLR in 2019. Conclusion:The results of this SLR informed the task force responsible for the 2023 update of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology recommendations for pharmacological management of PsA.",

        "abstract": "Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is an inborn error of immunity affecting both multiple endocrine organs and susceptibility to candidiasis, each with an autoimmune basis. Recently, high titer neutralizing anti-type I interferon (IFN) autoantibodies have been linked with increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 and varicella zoster virus infections in APECED patients. Examining immunity against cytomegalovirus (CMV), we found a higher prevalence of anti-CMV IgG antibodies in patients with APECED (N = 19) than in 44 healthy controls (90% vs 64%, p = 0.04); the similar difference in their IgG levels did not achieve significance (95 ± 74 vs 64 ± 35 IU/mL, ns.). In contrast, the frequency of CMV-specific T cells was lower (804 ± 718/million vs 1591 ± 972/million PBMC p = 0.03). We saw no correlations between levels of anti-CMV IgG and anti-IFN antibodies in APECED patients or in a separate cohort of patients with thymoma (n = 70), over 60% of whom also had anti-IFN antibodies. Our results suggest a dysregulated response to CMV in APECED patients and highlight immunodeficiency to viral infections as part of the disease spectrum.",

        "abstract": "Aim To evaluate the clinical characteristics, treatment course, and prognosis of patients with acute retinal necrosis (ARN), which can rapidly progress and cause severe vision loss. Design Single-center retrospective case series. Subjects and methods Six patients and seven eyes diagnosed with ARN at Teikyo University Hospital were included in this study. The clinical presentation and treatment prognosis were investigated based on data obtained from medical records. Results The mean age of the patients at the initial diagnosis was 63.6 years. Although the mean Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) visual acuity tended to decrease from 0.77 at the first visit to 1.29 at the last visit, the difference was not statistically significant. Intraocular manifestations observed during the study period included ocular hypertension (14.3%), anterior uveitis (100.0%), retinal hemorrhage (71.4%), vitreous opacity (100.0%), retinal exudative vasculitis (85.7%), optic nerve atrophy (85.7%), retinal vascular occlusion (85.7%), choroidal atrophy (85.7%), macular edema (100.0%), subretinal fluid in the macula (71.4%), and retinal detachment (85.7%). Treatment modalities included oral and intravitreal antivirals (85.7%), antiplatelet medications (85.7%), steroid eye drops (85.7%), subcapsular (57.1%) and vitreous (42.9%) steroid injections, oral steroids (71.4%), and surgical intervention (85.7%). Vitrectomy led to retinal recovery in all five eyes that underwent the procedure. Conclusions The visual prognosis of patients with ARN is poor, particularly in those with preexisting visual impairment. Early detection coupled with antiviral therapy and prompt surgical intervention have been identified as potential factors that influence visual outcomes. Given the severity of ARN, collecting data from multiple centers could aid in devising future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "As opposed to horizontal transmission between individuals in a population, vertical transmission of an infectious agent is generally defined as transmission from a pregnant individual to their fetus. Horizontal transmission during pregnancy is frequently examined based on timing (antenatal, perinatal, or postnatal); more specific considerations involve viral transplacental infections. Vertical antenatal and in-utero infections refer to the same general mechanism of infection, although the particular pathophysiologic mechanisms will vary with the infectious agent. Viral transplacental infections represent a critical category of maternal-fetal health concerns, with the capacity to traverse the placental barrier and adversely affect the developing fetus, leading to a range of outcomes, from mild disease to severe congenital anomalies or fetal death. Infectious agents that can cross the placenta include those historically described by \"ToRCHes\" (toxoplasmosis, other [hepatitis B virus and syphilis], rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus). However,Listeria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus B19, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis C virus, and Zika virus are also known to cause transplacental infections. Each infection can have profound implications for fetal development, with risks varying based on the timing of infection during pregnancy and the specific pathogen involved. See StatPearls' companion references, \"Antepartum infections,\" \"HIV in Pregnancy,\" and \"Pregnancy and Viral Hepatitis,\" for more information on vertically transmitted infections and associated intrapartum issues. Please note that the terms \"maternal\" and \"mother\" in this activity refer to the birthing parent and are not meant to exclude other birthing parents.",

Results:A 42-year-old male with a remote history of a motor vehicle accident, traumatic brain injury, extensive facial reconstructive surgery, and traumatic optic neuropathy presented with left periorbital swelling. He was found to have extensive periorbital and total hypoesthesia in the cranial nerve V1 distribution and partial hypoesthesia in the V2 distribution. Corneal findings were highly suspicious for herpes simplex keratitis or zoster ophthalmicus. The patient was diagnosed with herpetic epithelial and stromal keratitis with periorbital ulceration secondary to Trigeminal trophic syndrome. The patient was treated broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics, intravenous acyclovir, and topical antibiotics. He was treated with topical steroids upon closure of epithelial defect. Upon discharge, the patient's vision improved from hand-motion to 20/30 at near. The patient was later fit with a custom thermoplastic facial mask to minimize further selfinjurious behavior. Conclusions:To our knowledge, this is the first report of trigeminal trophic syndrome presenting with concurrent herpetic keratitis. Successful treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach to provide the patient insight and create protective equipment.",

        "abstract": "Polymicrobial infections are the leading causes of complications incurred from injuries that burn patients develop. Such patients admitted to the hospital have a high risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, with longer patient stays leading to increased chances of acquiring such drug-resistant infections. Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis are the most common multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria identified in burn wound infections (BWIs). BWIs caused by viruses, like Herpes Simplex and Varicella Zoster, and fungi-like Candida spp. appear to occur occasionally. However, the preponderance of infection by opportunistic pathogens is very high in burn patients. Variations in the causative agents of BWIs are due to differences in geographic location and infection control measures. Overall, burn injuries are characterized by elevated serum cytokine levels, systemic immune response, and immunosuppression. Hence, early detection and treatment can accelerate the wound-healing process and reduce the risk of further infections at the site of injury. A multidisciplinary collaboration between burn surgeons and infectious disease specialists is also needed to properly monitor antibiotic resistance in BWI pathogens, help check the super-spread of MDR pathogens, and improve treatment outcomes as a result.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To determine the advantages of next-generation metagenomic sequencing (mNGS) technology in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious keratitis (IK). Methods:A total of 287 patients with IK admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology of Nanjing First Hospital between August 2018 and December 2022 were analyzed retrospectively, and the pathogenic causes, etiological characteristics, detection, treatment methods, and efficacy were summarized. Results:Trauma and foreign matter were the most common causes of IK (144 patients, 50.2%). Of the 287 patients, 228 (79.4%) were diagnosed with a specific etiology, including 110 (48.2%) fungal infections, 44 (19.3%) viral infections, 42 (18.4%) mixed infections, and 30 (13.2%) bacterial infections. Filamentous fungi represented byFusariumandAspergilluswere the most common, followed by bacteria such asPseudomonas aeruginosa,Streptococcus pneumoniae, viruses (Herpes Simplex Virus/Varicella-Zoster Virus), and parasites. The positivity rates of secretion culture, corneal laser confocal microscopy (CM), mNGS, and pathological sections were 47.3% (133/281), 45.3% (111/245), 83.9% (104/124), and 19.3% (40/207), respectively. The positivity rate of mNGS for bacteria and viruses was higher than that of the other methods, and the positivity rate for fungi was the same as that for CM. As a result, 214 cases (74.6%) were cured, 51 cases (17.8%) improved, 8 cases (2.8%) did not heal, ocular content enucleation was performed in 14 cases (4.9%), and the overall efficacy rate was 92.3%. Conclusion:Trauma and foreign matter are the main causes of IK. The mNGS technology is an efficient and comprehensive detection method for viruses and bacteria, especially for mixed infections.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Herpes simplex (HSV) and varicella zoster (VZV) viruses are harmful infectious agents in pregnancy due to their ability to impact maternal-fetal dyads through various modalities including vertical transmission, neonatal infection, and maternal morbidity. As a result, accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment of these infections in pregnancy is critical. Case:A 19-year-old primigravida presented to our tertiary care center at 30 weeks' gestation with vulvar swelling, burning, and pain. Workup included direct PCR testing of a particularly erythematous area of the vulva which returned positive for VZV. The patient was treated with a 10-day course of acyclovir with resolution of her symptoms. She later had a full-term spontaneous vaginal delivery outside of the infectious window with no significant morbidity for either her or her neonate. Conclusion:Although a rare presentation, the presence of a genital lesion or labial swelling during pregnancy warrants workup for VZV, particularly among patients known to be varicella nonimmune. If genital VZV is diagnosed during pregnancy, the development of contingency plans through interdisciplinary collaboration should be pursued to ensure a safe delivery and postpartum course for both the maternal-fetal dyad as well as other patients on the unit and the provider care team.",

        "abstract": "Honey is a natural product used since ancient times due to its taste, aroma, and therapeutic properties (antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity). The purpose of this review is to present the species of microorganisms that can survive in honey and the effect they can have on bees and consumers. The techniques for identifying the microorganisms present in honey are also described in this study. Honey contains bacteria, yeasts, molds, and viruses, and some of them may present beneficial properties for humans. The antimicrobial effect of honey is due to its acidity and high viscosity, high sugar concentration, low water content, the presence of hydrogen peroxide and non-peroxidase components, particularly methylglyoxal (MGO), phenolic acids, flavonoids, proteins, peptides, and non-peroxidase glycopeptides. Honey has antibacterial action (it has effectiveness against bacteria, e.g.Escherichia coli,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus, andAcinetobacter,etc.), antifungal (effectiveness againstCandidaspp.,Aspergillusspp., Fusariumspp., Rhizopusspp.,andPenicilliumspp.), antiviral (effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2, Herpes simplex virus type 1, Influenza virus A and B, Varicella zoster virus), and antiparasitic action (effectiveness againstPlasmodium berghei, GiardiaandTrichomonas, Toxoplasma gondii) demonstrated by numerous studies that are comprised and discussed in this review.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis caused by Sphingomonas paucimobilis in a young male. Materials and methods:A retrospective case report. Results:A 25-year-old male presented with reduced vision in the right eye and recurrent past episodes of hypopyon uveitis. The right eye had vision of counting fingers close to the face with cells, flare, and hypopyon in the anterior chamber with vitritis and exudates in the fundus. Blood investigations for tuberculosis, syphilis, toxoplasma, sarcoidosis, RA, ANA, HLA B27, and HLA B29 were negative. Anterior chamber tap investigations for herpes simplex viruses, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasma, as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, yielded negative results. Ultrasound B-scan revealed a moderate number of low-reflective dot echoes in the vitreous, along with a few membranous echoes suggestive of vitritis. Blood culture and urine culture were negative. Since there was progressive deterioration, diagnostic and therapeutic vitrectomy was done with intravitreal antibiotics. The culture of the vitreous sample grew Sphingomonas paucimobilis. In the post-operative period, the patient developed retinal detachment, and re-surgery was done with a lensectomy, and the vision improved to 6/18 with contact lenses in the follow-up. Conclusion:This case report describes the distinct occurrence of endogenous endophthalmitis in an immunocompetent young male, which was previously reported only in peripartum cases. The clinical course is characterized by masquerading symptoms and recurrent episodes, despite the organism being of low virulence.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To discuss the prevention and treatment of persistent epithelial defects after the most common refractive surgeries-photorefractive keratectomy, laser in situ keratomileusis, or small incision lenticule extraction. Methods:PubMed was used to search the medical literature. Results:Persistent epithelial defects are infrequent after photorefractive keratectomy, laser in situ keratomileusis, or small incision lenticule extraction. In the authors' opinion, any persistent epithelial defect present at 1 week or beyond after surgery should be treated aggressively with a properly fit bandage contact lens, lubrication with non-preserved artificial tears, and treatment of any eyelid abnormalities, including nocturnal lagophthalmos. Consideration should be given for presumptive treatment for herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus infection. If the persistent epithelial defect does not close within 2 weeks, then other measures should be considered, such as autologous serum drops, topical losartan, amniotic membranes, and topical human recombinant nerve growth factor to limit corneal scarring fibrosis and microbial infection. Conclusions:Persistent epithelial defects are among the most feared complications of refractive surgery. Timely and aggressive treatment should be instituted to close the epithelium prior to the development of scarring fibrosis and/or microbial corneal infection.[J Refract Surg. 2024;40(2):e117-e124.].",

        "abstract": "Introduction:The safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg (UPA15) through week 216 was evaluated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the long-term extension (LTE) of the phase 3 SELECT-CHOICE study. Methods:Patients with RA refractory to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) were randomized to UPA15 or abatacept (ABA) for 24 weeks. During the open-label LTE, patients on ABA switched to UPA15 at week 24, and those on UPA15 continued treatment. The safety and efficacy of continuous UPA15, and ABA to UPA15, are summarized through week 216. Results:The LTE was comprised of 91.4% (n = 277/303) of patients that initially received UPA15, and 89.6% (n = 277/309) that initially received ABA. Of patients on UPA15 in the LTE (n = 547), 28.3% (n = 155/547) discontinued the study drug by week 216. Relative to other adverse events of special interest, and largely consistent with previous findings at week 24, higher rates of serious infection, COVID-19, herpes zoster, and elevated creatine phosphokinase were reported, while rates of malignancy excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), NMSC, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were low. Long-term safety data with UPA through week 216 aligned with previous observations and no new safety risks were identified, including in patients who switched from ABA to UPA15. Proportions of patients achieving 28-joint disease activity score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) < 2.6/ ≤ 3.2, clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simple disease activity index (SDAI) low disease activity/remission, ≥ 20%/50%/70% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR20/50/70) response criteria, and Boolean remission were maintained or improved with UPA15 through week 216. Improvements in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), patient's assessment of pain, and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) were also maintained or improved with UPA15 through week 216. Across all efficacy endpoints, similar results were observed in patients who switched from ABA to UPA15 versus continuous UPA15. Patients with an inadequate response to ≥ 1 prior tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (UPA15: n = 263/303, 86.8%; ABA to UPA15: n = 273/309, 88.3%) showed similar responses to the total population. Conclusions:The long-term safety profile of UPA was consistent with previous findings and the broader RA clinical program. Compared to the primary analyses at week 24, efficacy responses were maintained or further improved with UPA15 through week 216 in patients with RA.

        "abstract": "To compare prevalence of positive PCR tests for herpesviruses between patients with and without a history of clinical corneal endothelial allograft rejection (AGR). Retrospective cross-sectional study with two-group comparison. A total of 307 aqueous humor (AH) samples from 235 Patients and 244 eyes who underwent penetrating keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty or had a diagnostic AH aspiration due to clinical AGR between 2019 and 2023 were tested for DNA of herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). PCR test results were compared between the two groups (with/without AGR). Another sub-analysis examined the results of patients without a history of herpetic keratitis. A total of 8% of eyes with clinical AGR (9/108) had a positive PCR result for one of the herpesviruses (HSV:3, CMV:3, EBV:2, VZV:1). All patients in the group without AGR had negative PCR results for all previous viruses (0/136). The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The sub-analysis of eyes without a history of herpetic keratitis also revealed significantly more positive herpes PCR results (7/87) in eyes with AGR than in eyes without AGR (0/42, p = 0.005). Clinical AGR after keratoplasty shows a significant correlation to viral replication. Herpetic infection and AGR could occur simultaneously and act synergistically. Timely differentiation between active herpetic infection and/or AGR is pivotal for proper treatment and graft preservation.",

        "abstract": "Background:The incidence of meningoencephalitis (ME) in India is poorly understood, and the exact etiological diagnosis is often not possible. This study was planned to elucidate the bacterial and viral etiological diagnosis of ME in children less than 5 years of age. Materials and methods:The present study was conducted in Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL), Department of Microbiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, from July 2020 to June 2022. Serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and nose/throat swabs were collected from all the enrolled cases of meningoencephalitis in children below 5 years of age and tested for various etiological agents by ELISA and/or real-time PCR. Results:Of 130 enrolled cases, 50 (38.5%) cases tested positive for one or more etiological agents. Etiological agents of ME detected were Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (8.46%), adenovirus (6.92%), influenza virus (5.38%), dengue virus (3.85%), Parvo B-19 virus (3.08%), Orientia tsutsugamushi (3.08%), Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) (1.54%), measles virus (1.54%), and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) (1.54%). Rubella virus, Chikungunya virus (CHKV), Mumps virus, Enteroviruses, Parecho virus, John Cunningham virus (JC), BK virus, Nipah virus, Kyasanur Forest Disease virus (KFD), Chandipura virus, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-2), SARS CoV-2, N. Meningitides , and H. Influenzae were tested but not detected in any of the cases. Conclusion:We identified the etiological agents in 50/130 (38.5%) suspected ME cases in children less than 5 years of age, using molecular and ELISA-based diagnostic methods. The four most common pathogens detected were JEV, adenovirus, influenza virus, and dengue virus.",

        "abstract": "FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis panel (FAME-p) is used to diagnose central nervous system (CNS) infections. In this study, we investigated performance of FAME-p compared to comparator assays (CA), and for the first time, clinical diagnosis at discharge (CDD). 1000 consecutive patients with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample analyzed with FAME-p were identified. As CA, culture, polymerase chain reaction and cryptococcal antigen test were used. Medical records of patients were obtained. A CDD of CNS infection was made in 139 of 1000 CSF samples. FAME-p was positive in 66 samples with 44 viral and 22 bacterial agents. Thirteen FAME-p findings were not confirmed by CA, with four discrepant results remaining after comparison with the CDD. Positive percentage agreement (PPA) calculated against CA was 100%. Negative percentage agreement (NPA) calculated against CA was 94.4-99.8% for Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). NPA calculated against CDD was higher (compared to CA) for L. monocytogenes, S. agalactiae and VZV (100%), and lower for Escherichia coli, enterovirus and herpes simplex virus 2 (50-83.3%). NPA of FAME-p for human herpes virus 6 was difficult to interpret. Eighty-four cases received diagnosis of CNS-infection despite negative FAME-p. The four most common non-infectious etiologies were primary headache disorders, cranial nerve palsies, neuroinflammatory disorders and seizure. Although FAME-p shows good performance in diagnosis of CNS infections, result of FAME-p should be interpreted carefully. Considering infectious diseases not covered by FAME-p as well as non-infectious differential diagnoses is important in this context.",

        "title": "Antiviral medications for preventing cytomegalovirus disease in solid organ transplant recipients",
        "abstract": "Background:The risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in solid organ transplant recipients has resulted in the frequent use of prophylaxis to prevent the clinical syndrome associated with CMV infection. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and updated in 2008 and 2013. Objectives:To determine the benefits and harms of antiviral medications to prevent CMV disease and all-cause death in solid organ transplant recipients. Search methods:We contacted the information specialist and searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 5 February 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Selection criteria:We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing antiviral medications with placebo or no treatment, comparing different antiviral medications or different regimens of the same antiviral medications for CMV prophylaxis in recipients of any solid organ transplant. Studies examining pre-emptive therapy for CMV infection are studied in a separate review and were excluded from this review. Data collection and analysis:Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main results:This 2024 update found four new studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 41 (5054 participants). The risk of bias was high or unclear across most studies, with a low risk of bias for sequence generation (12), allocation concealment (12), blinding (11) and selective outcome reporting (9) in fewer studies. There is high-certainty evidence that prophylaxis with aciclovir, ganciclovir or valaciclovir compared with placebo or no treatment is more effective in preventing CMV disease (19 studies: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52), all-cause death (17 studies: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92), and CMV infection (17 studies: RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77). There is moderate-certainty evidence that prophylaxis probably reduces death from CMV disease (7 studies: RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78). Prophylaxis reduces the risk of herpes simplex and herpes zoster disease, bacterial and protozoal infections but probably makes little to no difference to fungal infection, acute rejection or graft loss. No apparent differences in adverse events with aciclovir, ganciclovir or valaciclovir compared with placebo or no treatment were found. There is high certainty evidence that ganciclovir, when compared with aciclovir, is more effective in preventing CMV disease (7 studies: RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.60). There may be little to no difference in any outcome between valganciclovir and IV ganciclovir compared with oral ganciclovir (low certainty evidence). The efficacy and adverse effects of valganciclovir or ganciclovir were probably no different to valaciclovir in three studies (moderate certainty evidence). There is moderate certainty evidence that extended duration prophylaxis probably reduces the risk of CMV disease compared with three months of therapy (2 studies: RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.35), with probably little to no difference in rates of adverse events. Low certainty evidence suggests that 450 mg/day valganciclovir compared with 900 mg/day valganciclovir results in little to no difference in all-cause death, CMV infection, acute rejection, and graft loss (no information on adverse events). Maribavir may increase CMV infection compared with ganciclovir (1 study: RR 1.34, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.65; moderate certainty evidence); however, little to no difference between the two treatments were found for CMV disease, all-cause death, acute rejection, and adverse events at six months (low certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions:Prophylaxis with antiviral medications reduces CMV disease and CMV-associated death, compared with placebo or no treatment, in solid organ transplant recipients. These data support the continued routine use of antiviral prophylaxis in CMV-positive recipients and CMV-negative recipients of CMV-positive organ transplants.",

        "abstract": "As autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is increasingly frequent in some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), the knowledge of its adverse effects is paramount. Early complications (within 30 from transplantation) are usually due to conditioning regimen and consequent neutropenia. They include infections and noninfectious complications, such as oral and intestinal mucositis, increases in liver enzymes, hemorrhagic cystitis, and worsening of neurologic symptoms. Infections in the early phase, particularly during neutropenia, are mainly of bacterial origin, such as bloodstream infections, pneumonia, central-venous catheter-related infections, urinary infections, and neutropenic typhlitis, followed by viral reactivations. Prophylaxis with acyclovir against reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is recommended, while a preemptive strategy is used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) management. Fungal infections are infrequent and mainly caused by Candida, thus fluconazole prophylaxis is used in some centers. Late complications include secondary autoimmune diseases: hematologic, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or acquired hemophilia, or nonhematologic, such as thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, or Crohn's disease. Other late complications are endocrinopathies and gonadal dysfunction with possible consequences on fertility. Particularly in women over 32 years of age, the risk of infertility and premature ovarian insufficiency can be significant. Thus, reproductive counseling with fertility preservation techniques if required is mandatory before ASCT.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To report an unusual case of bilateral aggressive Mooren ulcer that occurred in the setting of bilateral pterygia and showed a relentless course during pregnancy. Methods:A 39-year-old woman of Black African ethnicity, 36-week pregnant, presented to the eye casualty with bilateral nasal corneal ulcer and associated melt around preexisting pterygia. A detailed workup including microbial evaluation, culture and sensitivity, polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus, inflammatory blood profile, autoimmune markers, and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) screening was undertaken. Treatment was initiated in a stepwise approach. Results:Infections and systemic autoimmune and rheumatologic conditions were ruled out. A diagnosis of bilateral Mooren ulcer was made by exclusion. The peripheral blood was positive for HLA DQ2. As the condition seemed refractory to medical management (topical steroids and intravenous pulse methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone and topical cyclosporine), urgent bilateral conjunctival resection with multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation was performed to reduce the inflammatory stimulus and keratolysis. Stabilization of the condition warranted the need for systemic immunosuppressive agents. Using a multidisciplinary approach, in liaison with Obstetricians and Rheumatologists, the patient was planned for an earlier elective Cesarean section and commencement of oral mycophenolate mofetil postpartum, which aided in successful control of the disease. Conclusions:Mooren ulcer could follow an aggressive course during pregnancy, especially in the setting of preexisting pterygium. The complex hormonal and immunological changes during pregnancy and the delivery of inflammatory mediators directly onto the cornea by pterygium could contribute to the severity. A well-planned, stepwise, and multidisciplinary management is pivotal for the treatment of this condition.",

        "abstract": "Many health challenges are attributed to viral infections, which represent significant concerns in public health. Among these infections, diseases such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections have garnered attention due to their prevalence and impact on human health. There are specific antiviral medications available for the treatment of these viral infections. Drugs like Cidofovir, Valacyclovir, and Acyclovir are commonly prescribed. These antiviral drugs are known for their efficacy against herpesviruses and related viral infections, leveraging their ability to inhibit viral DNA polymerase. A molecular descriptor is a numerical value that correlates with specific physicochemical properties of a molecular graph. This article explores the calculation of distance-based topological descriptors, including the Trinajstic, Mostar, Szeged, and PI descriptors for the aforementioned antiviral drugs. These descriptors provide insights into these drugs' structural and physicochemical characteristics, aiding in understanding their mechanism of action and the development of new therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundData on infectious encephalitis in immunodeficient (ID) individuals are scarce. This population may present with atypical clinical symptoms, be infected by uncommon pathogens and develop poor outcomes.AimWe aimed to describe the epidemiology of infectious encephalitis among HIV-negative ID patients.MethodsPatients from the ENCEIF (Etude Nationale de Cohorte des Encéphalites Infectieuses en France) prospective cohort meeting criteria for infectious encephalitis between January 2016 and December 2019 were included. We compared clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results, biological results, infection causes and outcome of ID patients with immunocompetent (IC) patients using Pearson's chi-squared test and Student's t-test. We carried out logistic regression to assess the role of immunodeficiency as risk factor for poor outcome.ResultsID patients (n = 58) were older (mean 72 vs 59 years), had higher prevalence of diabetes (26% vs 12%), pre-existing neurological disorders (12% vs 5%) and higher case-fatality rate (23.6% vs 5.6%) compared to IC patients (n = 436). Varicella zoster virus was the primary cause of encephalitis in ID patients (this aetiology was more frequent in ID (25.9%) than in IC patients (11.5%)), with herpes simplex virus second (22.4% in ID patients vs 27.3% in IC patients). Immunodeficiency was an independent risk factor for death or major sequelae (odds ratio: 3.41, 95%CI: 1.70-6.85).ConclusionsVaricella zoster virus is the most frequent cause of infectious encephalitis in ID patients. Immunodeficiency is a major risk factor for poor outcome. ID encephalitis patients should benefit from stringent investigation of cause and early empiric treatment.",

        "abstract": "Obsessive‑compulsive disorder (OCD) is a current topic of discussion nowadays. OCD presents a variety of different etiologies including environmental, viral, cognitive, or genetic aspects. In this article, we focused on the possible correlation between various infectious diseases as well as generally the relationship between viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and an increased OCD risk. In this narrative review, we analyzed different types of articles found on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, as well as the articles of the National Institute of Mental Health. Searching criteria included articles from 1991 till the end of November, research involving human and animal patients (including monkeys and rats), and research published in English. Research showed a relationship between Herpes simplex virus, Rubella virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Borna disease virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, streptococcal infections, as well as gut microbiota and increased OCD risk. The possible mechanisms of this relation include neuroinflammation, brain tissue damage, autoimmune processes, and impairments in neurotransmitter levels. Infections caused by Varicella zoster virus, Measles virus, Mumps virus, Epstein‑Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, or Borrelia Burgdorferi may also contribute to the increased risk of OCD. Reports showed an increased frequency of OCD occurrence in a group of infected people compared to a healthy group. However, there is no evidence of the influence of Influenza virus, Coxsackie virus, Poliovirus, Parvovirus B19, Enterovirus 71, West Nile virus, Treponema Pallidum, or Toxocara infections on the OCD risk. There is a significant relationship between various infectious diseases and an increased OCD risk. However, further studies are crucial to discover the exact pathomechanisms of these correlations and the potential influence of other pathogens on the onset of OCD.",

Valacyclovir is an amino acid ester prodrug of acyclovir. We examined valacyclovir, which is also an anti-viral agent, for its effects on inflammation. Methods:Mammalian Macrophages were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of a concentration range of Valacyclovir. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-12p40 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the production levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. Results:Our results suggest that Valacyclovir had anti-inflammatory activity on the LPS-activated mammalian macrophages. Conclusion:Valacyclovir has the potential to be utilized in the clinical setting as an anti-viral drug molecule with anti-inflammatory properties. Future studies are needed to further confirm its activities on different immune system cell types.",

        "abstract": "Background:The Oka varicella vaccine strain remains neurovirulent and can establish lifelong latent infection, raising safety concerns about vaccine-related herpes zoster. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a skin-attenuated and neuro-attenuated varicella vaccine candidate (v7D vaccine). Methods:We did this randomised, double-blind, controlled, phase 2a clinical trial in Jiangsu, China. Healthy children aged 3-12 years with no history of varicella infection or vaccination were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive a single subcutaneous injection of the v7D vaccine at 3·3 log10plaque forming units (PFU; low-dose v7D group), 3·9 log10PFU (medium-dose v7D group), and 4·2 log10PFU (high-dose v7D group), or the positive control varicella vaccine (vOka vaccine group). All the participants, laboratory personnel, and investigators other than the vaccine preparation and management staff were masked to the vaccine allocation. The primary outcome was assessment of the geometric mean titres (GMTs) and seroconversion rates of anti-varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) induced by different dose groups of v7D vaccine at 0, 42, 60, and 90 days after vaccination in the per-protocol set for humoral immune response analysis. Safety was a secondary outcome, focusing on adverse events within 42 days post-vaccination, and serious adverse events within 6 months after vaccination. This study was registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000034434. Findings:On Aug 18-21, 2020, 842 eligible volunteers were enrolled and randomly assigned treatment. After three participants withdrew, 839 received a low dose (n=211), middle dose (n=210), or high dose (n=210) of v7D vaccine, or the vOka vaccine (n=208). In the per-protocol set for humoral immune response analysis, the anti-varicella zoster virus IgG antibody response was highest at day 90. At day 90, the seroconversion rates of the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups of v7D vaccine and the positive control vOka vaccine group were 100·0% (95% CI 95·8-100·0; 87 of 87 participants), 98·9% (93·8-100·0; 87 of 88 participants), 97·8% (92·4-99·7; 91 of 93 participants), and 96·4% (89·8-99·2; 80 of 83 participants), respectively; the GMTs corresponded to values of 30·8 (95% CI 26·2-36·0), 31·3 (26·7-36·6), 28·2 (23·9-33·2), and 38·5 (31·7-46·7). The v7D vaccine, at low dose and medium dose, elicited a humoral immune response similar to that of the vOka vaccine. However, the high-dose v7D vaccine induced a marginally lower GMT compared with the vOka vaccine at day 90 (p=0·027). In the per-protocol set, the three dose groups of the v7D vaccine induced a similar humoral immune response at each timepoint, with no statistically significant differences. The incidence of adverse reactions in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups of v7D vaccine was significantly lower than that in the vOka vaccine group (17% [35 of 211 participants], 20% [41 of 210 participants], and 13% [27 of 210 participants] vs 24% [50 of 208 participants], respectively; p=0·025), especially local adverse reactions (10% [22 of 211 participants], 14% [30 of 210 participants] and 9% [18 of 210 participants] vs 18% [38 of 208 participants], respectively; p=0·016). None of the serious adverse events were vaccine related. Interpretation:The three dose groups of the candidate v7D vaccine exhibit similar humoral immunogenicity to the vOka vaccine and are well tolerated. These findings encourage further investigations on two-dose vaccination schedules, efficacy, and the potential safety benefit of v7D vaccine in the future.

        "abstract": "Acute infectious encephalitis is a widely studied clinical syndrome. Although identified almost 100 years ago, its immediate and delayed consequences are still neglected despite their high frequency and possible severity. We reviewed the available data on sequelae and persisting symptoms following infectious encephalitis with the aim of characterizing the clinical picture of these patients at months to years after hospitalization. We searched PubMed for case series involving sequelae after infectious encephalitis. We carried out a narrative review of the literature on encephalitis caused by members of theHerpesviridaefamily (herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and human herpesvirus-6), members of theFlaviviridaefamily (West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus), alphaviruses, and Nipah virus. We retrieved 41 studies that yielded original data involving 3,072 adult patients evaluated after infectious encephalitis. At least one of the five domains of cognitive outcome, psychiatric disorders, neurological deficits, global functioning, and quality of life was investigated in the reviewed studies. Various tests were used in the 41 studies and the investigation took place at different times after hospital discharge. The results showed that most patients are discharged with impairments, with frequent deficits in cognitive function such as memory loss or attention disorders. Sequelae tend to improve within several years following flavivirus or Nipah virus infection, but long-term data are scarce for other pathogens. Further research is needed to better understand the extent of sequelae after infectious encephalitis, and to propose a standardized assessment method and assess the rehabilitation efficacy in these patients.",

Several acyclic nucleoside 4-(2,4-diaminopyrimidin-6-yl)oxy-but-2-enyl]phosphonic acid prodrug exhibited in vitro antiviral activity in submicromolar or nanomolar range against varicella zoster virus (VZV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), and vaccinia virus (VV), with good selective index (SI). Among them, the analogue 9c (LAVR-289) proved markedly inhibitory against VZV wild-type (TK+) (EC500.0035 μM, SI 740) and for thymidine kinase VZV deficient strains (EC500.018 μM, SI 145), with a low morphological toxicity in cell culture at 100 μM and acceptable cytostatic activity resulting in excellent selectivity. Compound 9c exhibited antiviral activity against HCMV (EC500.021 μM) and VV (EC500.050 μM), as well as against HSV-1 (TK-) (EC500.0085 μM). Finally, LAVR-289 (9c) deserves further (pre)clinical investigations as a potent candidate broad-spectrum anti-herpesvirus drug.",

        "abstract": "Chronic varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection induced neuroinflammatory condition is the critical pathology of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). The immune escape mechanism of VZV remains elusive. As to mice have no VZV infection receptor, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection is a well established PHN mice model. Transcriptional expression analysis identified that the protein arginine methyltransferases 6 (Prmt6) was upregulated upon HSV-1 infection, which was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining in spinal dorsal horn. Prmt6 deficiency decreased HSV-1-induced neuroinflammation and PHN by enhancing antiviral innate immunity and decreasing HSV-1 load in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of Prmt6 in microglia dampened antiviral innate immunity and increased HSV-1 load. Mechanistically, Prmt6 methylated and inactivated STING, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), diminished production of type I interferon (IFN-I) and antiviral innate immunity. Furthermore, intrathecal or intraperitoneal administration of the Prmt6 inhibitor EPZ020411 decreased HSV-1-induced neuroinflammation and PHN by enhancing antiviral innate immunity and decreasing HSV-1 load. Our findings revealed that HSV-1 escapes antiviral innate immunity and results in PHN by upregulating Prmt6 expression and inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway, providing novel insights and a potential therapeutic target for PHN.",

        "abstract": "Apoptosis is a critical host antiviral defense mechanism. But many viruses have evolved multiple strategies to manipulate apoptosis and escape host antiviral immune responses. Herpesvirus infection regulated apoptosis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Hence, the present study aimed to study the relationship between herpesvirus infection and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo using the pseudorabies virus (PRV) as the model virus. We found that mitochondria-dependent apoptosis was induced by PRV gM, a late protein encoded by PRV UL10, a virulence-related gene involved in enhancing PRV pathogenicity. Mechanistically, gM competitively combines with BCL-XL to disrupt the BCL-XL-BAK complex, resulting in BCL-2-antagonistic killer (BAK) oligomerization and BCL-2-associated X (BAX) activation, which destroys the mitochondrial membrane potential and activates caspase-3/7 to trigger apoptosis. Interestingly, similar apoptotic mechanisms were observed in other herpesviruses (Herpes Simplex Virus-1 [HSV-1], human cytomegalovirus [HCMV], Equine herpesvirus-1 [EHV-1], and varicella-zoster virus [VZV]) driven by PRV gM homologs. Compared with their parental viruses, the pathogenicity of PRV-ΔUL10 or HSV-1-ΔUL10 in mice was reduced with lower apoptosis and viral replication, illustrating that UL10 is a key virulence-related gene in PRV and HSV-1. Consistently, caspase-3 deletion also diminished the replication and pathogenicity of PRV and HSV-1 in vitro and in mice, suggesting that caspase-3-mediated apoptosis is closely related to the replication and pathogenicity of PRV and HSV-1. Overall, our findings firstly reveal the mechanism by which PRV gM and its homologs in several herpesviruses regulate apoptosis to enhance the viral replication and pathogenicity, and the relationship between gM-mediated apoptosis and herpesvirus pathogenicity suggests a promising approach for developing attenuated live vaccines and therapy for herpesvirus-related diseases.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To investigate differences in the retinal vessel area density (VAD) on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) between eyes with unilateral herpetic viral anterior uveitis (VAU) (herpes-simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)) and the non-affected fellow eye. Methods:In this monocentric, observational, prospective case series we analyzed the VAD of the macula, optic disc, and peripapillary region in affected and non-affected eyes of 22 patients with HSV-positive and 22 patients with VZV-positive VAU using OCTA. We analyzed also the visual field mean deviation (MD), the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, Bruch's Membrane Opening-Minimum Rim Width (BMO-MRW), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness on OCT and correlated the results with the different VADs. Results:The macular VAD in the superficial vascular plexus (SVC) was significant lower in the affected compared to the non-affected eye for both viruses (HSV: 33.0% ± 3.3% vs. 34.7% ± 2.6%,p= 0.011; adjustedp= 0.040; VZV: 33.1% ± 3.2% vs. 34.3% ± 2.8%,p= 0.012; adjustedp= 0.050). Additionally, the VAD of the peripapillary SVC differed between the affected and non-affected eye for VZV-positive VAU (47.1% ± 6.2% vs. 50.5% ± 6.3%,p= 0.048, adjustedp= 0.100). For both HSV-positive and VZV-positive VAU, there were correlations between macular or peripapillary SVC VAD and BMO-MRW, GCL thickness, RNFL thickness or MD of the affected eye. Conclusion:We observed vascular dysfunction characterized by decreased macular and peripapillary VAD in the superficial plexus on OCTA in eyes with HSV- and VZV-positive VAU compared to non-affected fellow eyes. These changes might be an early sign of glaucomatous damage or may be a direct consequence of the herpes viruses themselves.",

        "abstract": "Shortly after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cases of viral, bacterial, and fungal coinfections in hospitalized patients became evident. This retrospective study investigates the prevalence of multiple pathogen co-detections in 1472 lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples from 229 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients treated in the largest intensive care unit (ICU) in Slovenia. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, (rt)RT-PCR tests were used to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and atypical bacteria:Chlamydia pneumoniae,Mycoplasma pneumoniaeandLegionella pneumophila/spp. At least one co-detection was observed in 89.1% of patients. EBV, HSV-1, and CMV were the most common, with 74.7%, 58.1%, and 38.0% of positive patients, respectively. The median detection time of EBV, HSV-1, and CMV after initial SARS-CoV-2 confirmation was 11 to 20 days. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and tracheal aspirate (TA) samples showed equivalent performance for the detection of EBV, CMV, and HSV-1 in patients with both available samples. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a risk factor for latent herpesvirus reactivation, especially HSV-1, EBV, and CMV. However, additional studies are needed to elucidate the clinical importance of these findings.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:The epidemiology of encephalitis varies by region and time. Available Finnish data are outdated and there are no data from eastern parts of the country nor concerning the occurrence of autoimmune encephalitides. Materials and methods:Patients with encephalitis were identified from mandatory administrative registries in North Karelia Central Hospital. The diagnoses were verified and data extracted by reviewing the patient records. Study period was 2010-2021. Only patients &gt;16 years of age were included. Results:Fifty-one patients with a clinical encephalitis were identified (55% men) with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range 45, 73; total age range 16-88 years) indicating a crude incidence of 3.1/100,000 person-years for the entire study period. A specific aetiology could be identified in 31 cases (61%) with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) being the most common one (20% of all 51 cases), followed by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1, 16%) and varicella zoster virus (VZV, 14%). Autoimmune aetiology was confirmed in 10%. TBE was most often found in the youngest age group (16-52 years of age) and the herpes viruses in the oldest group (71 years or older). A specific cause was most often identified in the oldest patients (78%). TBE patients were younger than patients with VZV (p = 0.0009) or HSV-1 (p = 0.0057), but there was no difference when they were compared to patients with autoimmune (p = 0.27) or unknown (p = 0.074) aetiology. At presentation, there were differences in the occurrence of some clinical signs and symptoms between aetiologies but nothing specific. Eight patients (16%) were immunosuppressed. Inpatient seizures occurred in 10 patients (20%). In these cases, the aetiology was HSV-1 in 50% and TBE or VZV in none. A full recovery was observed in 51% of all patients while 3 patients (6%) had died of the encephalitis while in hospital or shortly after discharge. Conclusions:Adult-onset encephalitis was more common and the patients older in easternmost Finland than previously reported in other parts of the country. TBE, HSV-1, and VZV are the most commonly identified specific aetiologies whereas a fifth of the cases are probably caused by autoimmunity. Prognosis depended on aetiology but was very good in the majority of cases.",

        "abstract": "Objective:To describe the utility of film array meningoencephalitis (FAME) panel in the management of children with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Methods:A retrospective audit was conducted between January 2017 to July 2022. We included children aged < 18 years with a diagnosis of AES for whom a CSF analysis study including FAME panel testing performed within 48 hours of admission was available. Electronic medical records were reviewed for details including demographic profile, clinical presentation, investigations and outcome. Results:Out of 157 CSF samples sent for FAME panel testing, 49 were positive (31.4%.) Viral pathogens were identified in 42 (Enterovirus: 31, Human herpes virus 6: 9, Varicella zoster virus: 1, and Cytomegalovirus: 1) Bacterial pathogens were identified in 6 (Streptococcus pneumoniae: 2, Streptococcus agalactiae: 2, Hemophilus influenzae: 1, and Escherischia coli: 1). Fungal etiology (Cryptococcus neoformans) was detected in one child. Antibiotics could be stopped within 72 hours of initiation in 42 children in whom a viral etiology was established. Acyclovir could be stopped in 21 out of 32 children within 72 hours after the FAME panel testing. FAME panel was presumed to be false positive in 4 children. Conclusion:Etiology of AES could be established in nearly a third of children with AES using the rapid diagnostic FAME panel testing in CSF and it was found to be effective in reducing empirical antibiotic/antiviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "Objective:COVID-19 immunization was implemented with emergency-use authorization. We had concerns/lack of information on mRNA vaccine side effects in different inborn errors of immunity (IEI) types. Methods:We enrolled 141 patients (IEIP) and 151 healthy controls(HC) who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccine/s(Sinovac and/or Pfizer-BioNTech(mRNA vaccine), one to five doses), questioned them for side-effects, evaluated in three groups according to the vaccine/s they received; only Sinovac, only Pfizer-BioNTech, and both vaccines. Results:Arm pain, generalized weakness, myalgia, and fever were common side effects in IEI-P and HC groups. Generalized weakness/fatigue, fever, and palpitation were significantly frequent in IEI-P who experienced COVID-19 compared to those who did not (p = 0.021, p = 0.047, and p = 0.024, respectively). Severe symptoms after vaccination, new-onset splenomegaly and pancytopenia, urticaria, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation were seen in four IEI-P (2.8%). Conclusion:IEI-P mRNA vaccination is relatively safe compared to the conventional vaccine. Individuals who experience uncommon side effects should undergo immunological screening.",

        "abstract": "Background:The interrelation between infections, subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and dementia development is recognized, but not fully understood. This study explored the combined effect of specific infections and SCD on the risk of dementia. Objectives:To assess the influence ofHelicobacter pylori, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and human papillomavirus on dementia risk in individuals with varying cognitive statuses, especially focusing on those with and without SCD. Methods:A cohort of 1,100,540 participants aged 66 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service was divided into cognitively preserved (CP,n= 825,405) and SCD (n= 275,135) groups. This study analyzed the effects of single, dual, and triple infections on the risk of overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VaD) using incidence rates and hazard ratios. Results:The SCD group consistently showed a doubled risk of dementia, particularly AD, regardless of the number of infections. In the initial data, both the presence and number of infections, especially in the CP group, were associated with an increased dementia incidence and risk; however, this correlation disappeared after adjusting for covariates, hinting at a possible protective effect. Conclusion:Our findings emphasize that, while SCD is a steadfast risk factor for dementia, the role of infections is layered, subject to various influences, and requires more comprehensive exploration to fully understand their impact on dementia development.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:To create a supervised machine learning algorithm aimed at predicting an optimal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dilution when determining virus specific antibody indices to reduce the need for repeated tests. Methods:The CatBoost model was trained, optimized, and tested on a dataset with five input variables: albumin quotient, immunoglobulin G (IgG) in CSF, IgG quotient (QIgG), intrathecal synthesis (ITS) and limes quotient (LIM IgG). Albumin and IgG concentrations in CSF and serum were performed by immunonephelometry on Atellica NEPH 630 (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) and ITS and LIM IgG were calculated according to Reiber. Concentrations of IgG antibodies to measles, rubella, varicella zoster and herpes simplex 1/2 viruses were analysed in CSF and serum by ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). Optimal CSF dilution was defined for each virus and used as a classification variable while the standard operating procedure was set to start at 2×-dilution of CSF. Results:The dataset included 571 samples with the imbalanced distribution of the optimal CSF dilutions: 2× dilution n=440, 3× dilution n=109, 4× dilution n=22. The optimized CatBoost model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.971, and a test accuracy of 0.900. The model falsely classified 14 (9.9 %) samples of the testing set but reduced the need for repeated testing compared to the standard protocol by 42 %. The output of the CatBoost model is mostly dependant on the QIgG, ITS and CSF IgG variables. Conclusions:An accurate algorithm was achieved for predicting the optimal CSF dilution, which reduces the number of test repeats.",

        "abstract": "Purpose of review:Infections are the leading cause of non-relapse mortality following chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy, with viral infections being frequent both in the early and late phases post-infusion. We review the epidemiology of viral infections and discuss critical approaches to prevention and management strategies in this setting. Recent findings:Herpesviruses dominate the early period. herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections are rare due to widespread antiviral prophylaxis, but cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is increasingly observed, particularly in high-risk groups including B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-CAR-T-cell therapy recipients and patients receiving corticosteroids. While CMV end-organ disease is rare, CMV is associated with increased mortality, emphasizing the need to evaluate the broader impact of CMV on long-term hematological, infection, and survival outcomes. Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) has also emerged as a concern, with its diagnosis complicated by overlapping symptoms with neurotoxicity, underscoring the importance of considering viral encephalitis in differential diagnoses. Respiratory viruses are the most common late infections with a higher incidence after BCMA CAR-T-cell therapy. Vaccination remains a critical preventive measure against respiratory viruses but may be less immunogenic following CAR-T-cell therapy. The optimal timing, type of vaccine, and dosing schedule require further investigation. Summary:A better understanding of viral epidemiology and preventive trials are needed to improve infection prevention practices and outcomes following CAR-T-cell therapies.",

        "abstract": "Background:Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by mpox virus (MPXV) infection. Since May 2022, there has been a marked increase in human mpox cases in different regions. Rash, fever, and sore throat are typical signs of mpox. However, other viruses, such as the B virus (BV), herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus types 2 (HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV), can also infect people and cause comparable symptoms. Therefore, clinical symptoms and signs alone make distinguishing MPXV from these viruses difficult. Results:In this study, we combined suspension microarray technology with recombinase-aided amplification technology (RAA) to establish a high-throughput, sensitive, and quantitative method for detecting MPXV and other viruses that can cause similar symptoms. The experimental results confirmed that the technique has outstanding sensitivity, with a minimum detection limit (LOD) of 0.1 fM and a linear range of 0.3 fM to 20 pM, spanning five orders of magnitude. The approach also exhibits exquisite selectivity, as the amplified signal can only be detected when the target virus nucleic acid is present. Additionally, serum recoveries ranging from 80.52% to 119.09% suggest that the detection outcomes are generally considered reliable. Moreover, the time required for detection using this high-throughput method is very short. After DNA extraction, the detection signal amplified by isothermal amplification on the bead array can be obtained in just 1 h. Significance and novelty:Our research introduces a new technique that utilizes suspension microarray technology and isothermal amplification to create a high-throughput nucleic acid assay. This innovative method offers multiple benefits compared to current techniques, such as being cost-effective, time-efficient, highly sensitive, and having high throughput capabilities. Furthermore, the assay is applicable not only for detecting MPXV and viruses with similar symptoms, but also for clinical diagnostics, food safety, and environmental monitoring, rendering it an effective tool for screening harmful microorganisms.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Prostate cancer (PCa) is by far the most common type of cancer among men in western countries. However, relatively little is known about its etiology despite the high morbidity and mortality. It has been suggested that chronic inflammation may be involved in prostate carcinogenesis. We investigated the role of sexually and non-sexually transmitted infections in prostate cancer risk with a specific interest in the aggressive types. Methods:We used data from epidemiological study of prostate cancer (EPICAP), a population-based case-control study. A total of 819 incident cases and 879 controls were interviewed face-to-face using a standardized questionnaire gathering information on known or suspected risk factors of prostate cancer and personal history of specific sexually and non-sexually transmitted infections: gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomonas, herpes, mononucleosis, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster, and dengue. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence interval were estimated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression. Results:There was no significant association between gonorrhea (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.61-1.33), trichomonas (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.27-2.07), genital herpes (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.38-1.27), and the risk of prostate cancer. No association emerged for overall sexually transmitted bacterial and viral infections (OR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.86-1.29) and overall non-sexually transmitted viral infections (OR 1.11, 95% CI: 0.90-1.35) and the risk of prostate cancer. Conclusion:Our results showed that sexually or non-sexually transmitted infections, either bacterial or viral, were not associated to prostate cancer. Therefore, further investigation is needed to help advance our understanding of the role of chronic inflammation in the etiology of prostate cancer, with a particular focus on its most aggressive types.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To evaluate features of infectious panuveitis associated with multiple pathogens detected by ocular fluid sampling. Methods:Single-center, retrospective, consecutive case series of patients with aqueous/vitreous polymerase chain reaction testing with >1 positive result in a single sample from 2001 to 2021. Results:Of 1,588 polymerase chain reaction samples, 28 (1.76%) were positive for two pathogens. Most common pathogens were cytomegalovirus (n = 16, 57.1%) and Epstein-Barr virus (n = 13, 46.4%), followed by varicella zoster virus (n = 8, 28.6%), Toxoplasma gondii (n = 6, 21.4%), herpes simplex virus 2 (n = 6, 21.4%), herpes simplex virus 1 (n = 6, 21.4%), and Toxocara (n = 1, 3.6%). Mean initial and final visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) were 1.3 ± 0.9 (Snellen ∼20/400) and 1.3 ± 1.1 (Snellen ∼20/400), respectively. Cytomegalovirus-positive eyes (n = 16, 61.5%) had a mean final visual acuity of 0.94 ± 1.1 (Snellen ∼20/175), whereas cytomegalovirus-negative eyes (n = 10, 38%) had a final visual acuity of 1.82 ± 1.0 (Snellen ∼20/1,320) ( P < 0.05). Main clinical features included intraocular inflammation (100%), retinal whitening (84.6%), immunosuppression (65.4%), retinal hemorrhage (38.5%), and retinal detachment (34.6%). Conclusion:Cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus were common unique pathogens identified in multi-PCR-positive samples. Most patients with co-infection were immunosuppressed with a high rate of retinal detachment and poor final visual acuity. Cytomegalovirus-positive eyes had better visual outcomes compared with cytomegalovirus-negative eyes.",

        "abstract": "Objective:This study was aimed primarily at describing the results of aqueous real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and reporting the rate of therapeutic modifications directly attributable to this procedure (profitability). Our secondary outcome was to compare demographic and clinical characteristics between patients with RT-PCR positivity and those with RT-PCR negative results. Design:Retrospective observational study conducted at the Uveitis Service of San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) between November 2016 and July 2022. Participants:Patients with infectious uveitis suspect (anterior, intermediate, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis). Methods:Patients with suspected infectious uveitis underwent aqueous RT-PCR for detection of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Toxoplasma gondii. Results:Sixty-five eyes of 61 patients (60 ±16 years of age; 54% males) were included. Aqueous RT-PCR tested positive in 58% and negative in 42% of patients. CMV and HSV-1 were the most frequently detected pathogens. RT-PCR confirmed clinical suspicion in 38% of patients and altered the presumed etiologic diagnosis and treatment in 20% of patients. Profitability was associated with CMV positivity. HSV-1 positivity was related to iris atrophy. CMV positivity was correlated with keratic precipitates. Vitritis and retinitis were related to VZV, CMV, and T. gondii detection. Synechiae, retinitis, and neuritis were related to positive tests regardless of the pathogen investigated. Early complications related to paracentesis were rarely reported. Conclusion:Aqueous RT-PCR was a safe semi-invasive tool to confirm a presumptive diagnosis and to change initial suspicion in ambiguous cases of herpetic uveitis. Thus aqueous RT-PCR may alter therapeutic management.",

        "abstract": "Objectives:We report the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in an ongoing long-term extension (LTE) study. Methods:Patients (2-<18 years) with JIA who completed phase 1/3 index studies or discontinued for reasons excluding treatment-related serious adverse events (AEs) entered the LTE study and received tofacitinib 5 mg two times per day or equivalent weight-based doses. Safety outcomes included AEs, serious AEs and AEs of special interest. Efficacy outcomes included improvement since tofacitinib initiation per the JIA-American College of Rheumatology (ACR)70/90 criteria, JIA flare rate and disease activity measured by Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)27, with inactive disease corresponding to JADAS ≤1.0. Results:Of 225 patients with JIA (median (range) duration of treatment, 41.6 (1-103) months), 201 (89.3%) had AEs; 34 (15.1%) had serious AEs. 10 patients developed serious infections; three had herpes zoster. Two patients newly developed uveitis. Among patients with polyarticular course JIA, JIA-ACR70/90 response rates were 60.0% (78 of 130) and 33.6% (47 of 140), respectively, at month 1, and generally improved over time. JIA flare events generally occurred in <5% of patients through to month 48. Observed mean (SE) JADAS27 was 22.0 (0.6) at baseline, 6.2 (0.7) at month 1 and 2.8 (0.5) at month 48, with inactive disease in 28.8% (36 of 125) of patients at month 1 and 46.8% (29 of 82) at month 48. Conclusions:In this interim analysis of LTE study data in patients with JIA, safety findings were consistent with the known profile of tofacitinib, and efficacy was maintained up to month 48.

        "abstract": "The most commonly used animal models for evaluating the efficacy of HSV-2 candidate vaccines are mice and guinea pigs. While numerous HSV-2 vaccine candidates have been tested in these animals and were effective in reducing disease and mortality, these results did not predict the effectiveness of the vaccines in human trials. Infection of rhesus macaques rarely results in lesions or HSV-2 specific antibody responses. In seeking an animal model that better recapitulates human disease and that might be more predictive of the efficacy of prophylactic vaccines than mice and guinea pigs, we evaluated Cebus apella (C. apella), a New World primate, in an HSV-2 genital infection model. Infectious HSV-2 was cultured from vaginal swabs from all 4 animals for 9-14 days after intravaginal inoculation of HSV-2 seronegative monkeys. Two of 4 monkeys had vesicular lesions in the vagina or vulva. No neurological symptoms were noted. Recurrent lesions and HSV-2 DNA shedding after acute disease resolved was infrequent. UV irradiation of the genital area did not induce recurrent genital lesions or virus shedding. All 4 monkeys developed HSV-2 neutralizing antibodies as well as virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. Reinfection of animals 15 to 19 months after primary infection did not result in lesions; animals had reduced virus shedding and a shorter duration of shedding compared with that during primary infection, suggesting that primary infection induced protective immunity. Primary fibroblasts from C. apella monkeys supported the growth of HSV-2 in vitro; in contrast, HSV-2 did not replicate above the titer of the input inoculum in fibroblasts from rhesus macaques. These observations suggest that the C. apella monkey has potential to serve as a model for evaluating the efficacy of prophylactic vaccines, antivirals, or monoclonal antibodies to HSV-2.",

Treatment with BTK or BCL-2 inhibitors does not seem to increase significantly the risk of opportunistic infections, but the role of combination therapies including BTK and/or BCL-2 inhibitors remains to be established. Various infectious complications can be successfully prevented with appropriate risk management strategies. In this paper we reviewed the international guidelines on prevention and management of infectious complications in patients with CLL treated with BTK or BCL-2 inhibitors. Universal pharmacological anti-herpes, antibacterial or antifungal prophylaxis is not warranted. Reactivation of HBV should be prevented in HBsAg-positive subjects. For HBsAg-negative/HBcAb-positive patients recommendations differ, but in case of combination treatment should follow those for other, particularly anti-CD20, agent. Immunization should be provided preferably before the onset of treatment. Immunoglobulin therapy has favourable impact on morbidity but not mortality in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and severe or recurrent infections. Lack of high-quality data and heterogeneity of patients or protocols included in the studies might explain differences among the main guidelines. Better data collection is warranted.",

Methods:A double-masked, cross-sectional case-control study at a tertiary eye clinic. Results:Thirty eyes of 30 subjects were analyzed. Fifteen eyes (50%) were CMV positive, while fifteen eyes were negative for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus and CMV. Absence of pseudoguttata was the strongest, independent risk factor for CMV (OR 34.53, 95% CI: 1.84-648.02, p = 0.018), followed by severe iris depigmentation (OR 31.45, 1.02-965.81, p = 0.048) and low corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) (OR 14.79, 1.14-191.30, p = 0.039) on univariable regression. All three remained statistically significant after adjustment. The combination of absence of pseudoguttata and low ECD on IVCM achieved a similar predictive value as iris depigmentation examination. Conclusion:Absence of pseudoguttata on IVCM was an independent predictor of positive CMV detection after adjusting for iris depigmentation and corneal endothelial cell density. The addition of this feature to severe iris depigmentation and low corneal ECD can increase the positive predictive value of detecting CMV. IVCM was a useful non-invasive tool to predict CMV in patients with chronic or recurrent AU.",

        "abstract": "The rapid and broad microbiological diagnosis of meningoencephalitis (ME) has been possible thanks to the development of multiplex PCR tests applied to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We aimed to assess a new multiplex PCR panel (the QIAstat-Dx ME panel), which we compared to conventional diagnostic tools and the Biofire FilmArray ME Panel. The pathogens analyzed using both methods wereEscherichia coliK1,Haemophilus influenzae,Listeria monocytogenes,Neisseria meningitidis,Streptococcus agalactiae,Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterovirus, herpes simplex virus 1-2, human herpesvirus 6, human parechovirus, varicella zoster virus, andCryptococcus neoformans/gattii. We used sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and kappa correlation index parameters to achieve our objective. Fifty CSF samples from patients with suspected ME were included. When conventional methods were used, 28 CSF samples (56%) were positive. The sensitivity and specificity for QIAstat-Dx/ME were 96.43% (CI95%, 79.8-99.8) and 95.24% (75.2-99.7), respectively, whereas the PPV and NPV were 96.43% (79.8-99.8) and 95.24% (75.1-99.7), respectively. The kappa value was 91.67%. Conclusions: A high correlation of the QIAstat-Dx ME panel with reference methods was shown. QIAstat-Dx ME is a rapid-PCR technique to be applied in patients with suspected ME with a high accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Neurotropic viruses, characterized by their capacity to invade the central nervous system, present a considerable challenge to public health and are responsible for a diverse range of neurological disorders. This group includes a diverse array of viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, poliovirus, enterovirus and Japanese encephalitis virus, among others. Some of these viruses exhibit high neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence, while others demonstrate weaker neuroinvasive and neurovirulent properties. The clinical manifestations of infections caused by neurotropic viruses can vary significantly, ranging from mild symptoms to severe life-threatening conditions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have garnered considerable attention due to their pivotal role in intracellular communication, which modulates the biological activity of target cells via the transport of biomolecules in both health and disease. Investigating EVs in the context of virus infection is crucial for elucidating their potential role contribution to viral pathogenesis. This is because EVs derived from virus-infected cells frequently transfer viral components to uninfected cells. Importantly, EVs released by virus-infected cells have the capacity to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thereby impacting neuronal activity and inducing neuroinflammation. In this review, we explore the roles of EVs during neurotropic virus infections in either enhancing or inhibiting viral pathogenesis. We will delve into our current comprehension of the molecular mechanisms that underpin these roles, the potential implications for the infected host, and the prospective diagnostic applications that could arise from this understanding.",

        "abstract": "Background:Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a notifiable infectious disease in China. Information on every case of JE is reported to the superior health administration department. However, reported cases include both laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases. This study aimed to differentiate between clinical and laboratory-confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, and improve the accuracy of reported JE cases by analyzing the acute-phase serum and cerebrospinal fluid of all reported JE cases in the Sichuan province from 2012 to 2022. Methods:All acute-phase serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid samples of the reported JE cases were screened for IgM(ImmunoglobulinM)to JEV using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the detection of the viral genes of JEV and 9 other pathogens including enterovirus (EV), using reverse transcription PCR was attempted. Epidemiological analyses of JE and non-JE cases based on sex, age, onset time, and geographical distribution were also performed. Results:From 2012 to 2022, 1558 JE cases were reported in the Sichuan province. The results of serological (JEV-specific IgM) and genetic testing for JEV showed that 81% (1262/1558) of the reported cases were confirmed as JEV infection cases (laboratory-confirmed cases). Among the 296 cases of non-JEV infection, 6 viruses were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid in 62 cases, including EV and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), constituting 21% (62/296) of all non-JE cases. Among the 62 non-JEV infection cases with confirmed pathogens, infections with EV and EBV included 17 cases each, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1/2) included 14 cases, varicella- zoster virus included 6 cases, mumps virus included 2 cases, and human herpes viruses-6 included 1 case. Additionally, there were five cases involving mixed infections (two cases of EV/EBV, one case of HSV-1/HSV-2, one case of EBV/HSV-1, and one case of EV/herpes viruses-6). The remaining 234 cases were classified as unknown viral encephalitis cases. Our analysis indicated that those aged 0-15 y were the majority of the patients among the 1558 reported JE cases. However, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed JE cases in the >40 y age group has increased in recent years. The temporal distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases of JE revealed that the majority of cases occurred from May to September each year, with the highest incidence in August. Conclusion:The results of this study indicate that there is a certain discrepancy between clinically diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed cases of JE. Each reported case should be based on laboratory detection results, which is of great importance in improving the accuracy of case diagnosis and reducing misreporting. Our results are not only important for addressing JE endemic to the Sichuan province, but also provide a valuable reference for the laboratory detection of various notifiable infectious diseases in China and other regions outside China.",

        "abstract": "The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) virion host shutoff (vhs) protein is an endoribonuclease that regulates the translational environment of the infected cell, by inducing the degradation of host mRNA via cellular exonuclease activity. To further understand the relationship between translational shutoff and mRNA decay, we have used ectopic expression to compare HSV1 vhs (vhsH) to its homologues from four other alphaherpesviruses - varicella zoster virus (vhsV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (vhsB), equine herpesvirus 1 (vhsE) and Marek's disease virus (vhsM). Only vhsH, vhsB and vhsE induced degradation of a reporter luciferase mRNA, with poly(A)+insituhybridization indicating a global depletion of cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNA and a concomitant increase in nuclear poly(A)+ RNA and the polyA tail binding protein PABPC1 in cells expressing these variants. By contrast, vhsV and vhsM failed to induce reporter mRNA decay and poly(A)+ depletion, but rather, induced cytoplasmic G3BP1 and poly(A)+ mRNA- containing granules and phosphorylation of the stress response proteins eIF2α and protein kinase R. Intriguingly, regardless of their apparent endoribonuclease activity, all vhs homologues induced an equivalent general blockade to translation as measured by single-cell puromycin incorporation. Taken together, these data suggest that the activities of translational arrest and mRNA decay induced by vhs are separable and we propose that they represent sequential steps of the vhs host interaction pathway.",

        "abstract": "The impact of viral keratitis (VK) on individuals and society is notable. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in managing viral keratitis effectively. Timely intervention with antiviral medications and supportive care can help mitigate the severity of the infection and improve visual outcomes. We examined the prevalence of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), adenovirus (AdV) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in patients suspected for ocular infections. Patients included in the study exhibited various clinical manifestations indicative of ocular pathology, such as infectious keratitis, corneal scar, endogenous endophthalmitis, panuveitis, endothelitis, stromal edema, and other relevant conditions. Four different types of tear fluid, corneal samples epithelium, aqueous humor and vitreous humor were taken. After genome extraction, multiplex real-time PCR was used for diagnosis of viruses. 48 (29.6%) out of the total of 162 (100%) eye specimen were positive. The dominant prevalence was VZV (12.3%) and HSV-1 (11.7%) followed by AdV (4.9%) and HSV-2 (0.6%). There were 4 (8.3%) coinfections within the samples (HSV-1 and VZV). Aqueous humor samples demonstrated superior virus detection ability and our only HSV-2 positive sample was from aqueous humor. The utilization of multiplex real-time PCR assays in differential diagnosis of VK holds promise for expeditious diagnoses while also preventing unwarranted antibiotic prescriptions. Moreover, the aqueous humor appears to be a more sensitive site for detecting viral keratitis.",

        "abstract": "Background:Little is known about the aetiology of urethral discharge syndrome (UDS) and genital ulcer disease (GUD) in Brazil due to limited access to laboratory tests and treatment based mainly on the syndromic approach. Objectives:To update Brazilian treatment guidelines according to the current scenario, the first nationwide aetiological study for UDS and GUD was performed. Methods:Male participants with urethral discharge (UD) and/or genital ulcer (GU) reports were enrolled. Sample collection was performed by 12 sentinel sites located in the five Brazilian regions. Between 2018 and 2020, 1141 UD and 208 GU samples were collected in a Universal Transport Medium-RT (Copan). A multiplex quantitative PCR kit (Seegene) was used to detect UD:Chlamydia trachomatis(CT),Mycoplasma genitalium(MG),M. hominis(MH),Neisseria gonorrhoeae(NG),Trichomonas vaginalis(TV),Ureaplasma parvum(UP),U. urealyticum(UU) and another kit to detect GU: cytomegalovirus (CMV),Haemophilus ducreyi(HD), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV),Treponema pallidum(TP) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Results:In UD samples, the frequency of pathogen detection was NG: 78.38%, CT: 25.6%, MG: 8.3%, UU: 10.4%, UP: 3.5%, MH: 3.5% and TV: 0.9%. Coinfection was assessed in 30.9% of samples, with 14.3% of NG/CT coinfection. The most frequent pathogen identified in GU was HSV2, present in 40.8% of the samples, followed by TP at 24.8%, LGV and CMV at 1%, and HSV1 at 0.4%. Coinfection of TP/HSV2 was detected in 4.4% of samples. VZV and HD were not detected. In 27.7% of the GU samples, no pathogen was detected. Conclusion:This study provided the acquisition of unprecedented data on the aetiology of UDS and GUD in Brazil, demonstrated the presence of a variety of pathogens in both sample types and reaffirmed the aetiologies known to be most prevalent globally.",

        "abstract": "Background:Opportunistic infections in the central nervous system (CNS) of people with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) remain significant contributors to morbidity and mortality, especially in resource-limited scenarios. Diagnosing these infections can be challenging, as brain imaging is non-specific and expensive. Therefore, molecular analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may offer a more accurate and affordable method for diagnosing pathogens. Methods:We conducted extensive real-time PCR testing (qPCR) on CSF to evaluate etiological agents in PLWHA with neurological manifestations. Primers targeting DNA from specific pathogens, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), John Cunningham virus (JCV),Toxoplasma gondii, and human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2), were used. Results:Cerebrospinal fluid samples revealed 90 pathogens (36.7%).Toxoplasma gondiiwas the most frequently detected pathogen, found in 22 samples (30.5%). Other pathogens included Cryptococcus sp. (7.7%), EBV (5.3%), CMV, VZV, and JCV (4.0% each). Conclusion:Despite antiretroviral therapy and medical follow-up, opportunistic central nervous system infections remain frequent in PLWHA. Herpesviruses are commonly detected, butT. gondiiis the most prevalent opportunistic pathogen in our study population. Therefore, molecular diagnosis is a crucial tool for identifying opportunistic infections, even in patients undergoing treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background:Infectious meningoencephalitis (ME) is a major global health concern. Viruses are the most frequently implicated etiologies, whereas bacterial causes, although life-threatening, constitute a lesser proportion of ME cases, together with other pathogens. The strict implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures led to the decreased viral and non-viral infectious diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of these mea-sures on ME-causing pathogens by age groups. Methods:This retrospective study aimed to determine and compare the rates of pathogen-positive ME cases during the pre-pandemic (P-1) and pandemic (P-2) periods. Molecular diagnostic methods using the cerebrospinal fluid of patients from all age groups were included. The positivity rate difference of the ME-causing pathogens between the two study periods was compared and the distribution pattern of the pathogens among the age groups was determined. Results:The overall positivity rate for at least one ME-causing pathogen during P-1 was 22.0% (503/2,284), which significantly declined to 7.3% (83/1,141) during P-2 (p < 0.001). Particularly, a statistically significant decline in the pathogen positivity was observed in the groups 4 - 6 (≥ 3 years) (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.041, respectively). Specifically, the enterovirus cases decreased significantly, whereas the varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus-2 cases increased. Among bacterial causes, the S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, and E. coli K1 ME cases significantly increased. Men and women had no significant differences in the positivity rate during either study period. Conclusions:COVID-19 mitigation measures significantly impacted the positivity rates and the distribution of ME-causing agents, especially in the age groups ≥ 3 years, although not uniformly.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Necrotizing viral retinitis is a serious eye infection that requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. Uncertain clinical suspicion can result in delayed diagnosis, inappropriate administration of corticosteroids, or repeated intraocular sampling. To quickly and accurately distinguish between viral and noninfectious retinitis, we aimed to develop deep learning (DL) models solely using noninvasive blood test data. Methods:This cross-sectional study trained DL models using common blood and serology test data from 3080 patients (noninfectious uveitis of the posterior segment [NIU-PS] = 2858, acute retinal necrosis [ARN] = 66, cytomegalovirus [CMV], retinitis = 156). Following the development of separate base DL models for ARN and CMV retinitis, multitask learning (MTL) was employed to enable simultaneous discrimination. Advanced MTL models incorporating adversarial training were used to enhance DL feature extraction from the small, imbalanced data. We evaluated model performance, disease-specific important features, and the causal relationship between DL features and detection results. Results:The presented models all achieved excellent detection performances, with the adversarial MTL model achieving the highest receiver operating characteristic curves (0.932 for ARN and 0.982 for CMV retinitis). Significant features for ARN detection included varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immunoglobulin M (IgM), herpes simplex virus immunoglobulin G, and neutrophil count, while for CMV retinitis, they encompassed VZV IgM, CMV IgM, and lymphocyte count. The adversarial MTL model exhibited substantial changes in detection outcomes when the key features were contaminated, indicating stronger causality between DL features and detection results. Conclusions:The adversarial MTL model, using blood test data, may serve as a reliable adjunct for the expedited diagnosis of ARN, CMV retinitis, and NIU-PS simultaneously in real clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Introduction:Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a severe eye disease demanding swift treatment to prevent blindness. Early action involving antiviral medications and corticosteroids is crucial for optimal visual outcomes. Objective:We present an ARN case series showcasing treatment experience and results. Methodology:Patients diagnosed with ARN based on SUN Working Group 2021 criteria were included; all underwent comprehensive eye exams, PCR analysis, and imaging. Results:Eight patients were studied; PCR confirmed ARN in six. Induction treatment, either oral valacyclovir (5/8) or intravenous acyclovir (3/8), lasted 10-14 days. Maintenance included oral valacyclovir (6/8), oral valganciclovir (2/8) for six months, along with intravitreal ganciclovir. Visual outcomes were similar for oral and intravenous therapies; poor baseline acuity and macular involvement tend to result in a worse final acuity. Conclusions:Swift treatment is vital to ARN management. Our findings emphasize effective treatment strategies' role in visual prognosis.

        "abstract": "Purpose:To report a rare case of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated non-necrotizing viral retinopathy, occlusive retinal vasculitis, papillitis, and retinal neovascularization in a young 41-year-old woman. Methods:Case report. Results:The patient presented with features of papillitis, peripapillary cotton-wool spots, pre-retinal hemorrhages, and occlusive vasculitis. Her visual acuity was 20/100 in the left eye. She developed a worsening of the disease upon initiation of systemic corticosteroids. Her serum immunoglobulins (Ig) (both IgG and IgM) were highly positive for CMV. Anterior chamber paracentesis was positive for CMV DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction. After stopping systemic corticosteroids, she was initiated on oral valganciclovir, with rapid resolution of the vasculitis and cotton-wool spots. After three months, the patient developed retinal neovascularization and underwent pan-retinal photocoagulation. However, her uveitis was inactive, and her visual acuity improved to 20/25. Conclusions:Non-necrotizing viral retinopathy has been associated with either varicella zoster virus (VZV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV). Our case highlights that CMV can also lead to non-necrotizing retinopathy and must be suspected in patients who may be negative for VZV and HSV. Appropriate anti-viral treatment can prevent severe vision loss in these patients.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has commonly been reported as a cause of anterior uveitis and corneal endotheliitis. Unlike its other herpetic family members, herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus, involvement of the corneal stroma in CMV is uncommon. In this case series, we describe patients with CMV stromal keratitis. Methods:This was a retrospective chart review of patients seen at a tertiary referral center from 1999 to 2023 with stromal keratitis who tested positive for CMV by directed polymerase chain reaction of aqueous fluid or corneal tissue. Results:This series describes 5 patients, 4 of whom presented with anterior uveitis and stromal keratitis and were confirmed to be positive for CMV through the polymerase chain reaction of aqueous fluid. The fifth patient experienced recurrent corneal graft failures, with the most recent failed graft being positive for CMV based on immunohistochemical stains of the corneal stroma. The average age of patients was 62 years (range 36-80 years). Only 1 patient (20%) exhibited elevated intraocular pressure with stellate keratic precipitates at the initial presentation, whereas 3 other patients (60%) had a known history of glaucoma. Conclusions:Uveitis specialists are well aware of CMV as a cause of recurrent, hypertensive anterior uveitis but should also consider CMV in cases featuring stromal keratitis.

        "abstract": "Acyclovir (ACV), a synthetic nucleoside derivative of purine, is one of the most potent antiviral medications recommended in the specific management of varicella-zoster and herpes simplex viruses. The molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was utilized to create an effective and specific electrochemical sensor using a straightforward photopolymerization process to determine ACV. The polymeric thin coating was developed using the template molecule ACV, a functional monomer acrylamide, a basic monomer 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, a cross-linker ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and a photoinitiator 2-hydroxy-2-methyl propiophenone on the exterior of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry were employed for the purpose of characterizing the constructed sensor (AM-ACV@MIP/GCE). Differential pulse voltammetry and a 5 mM ferrocyanide/ferricyanide ([Fe(CN)6]3-/4-) redox reagent were used to detect the ACV binding to the specific cavities on MIP. The study involves density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which were conducted to investigate template-functional monomer interactions thoroughly, calculate template-functional monomer interaction energies, and determine the optimal template/functional monomer ratio. DFT calculations were performed using Becke's three-parameter hybrid functional with the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) method and 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The sensor exhibits linear performance throughout the concentration region 1 × 10-11to 1 × 10-10M, and the limit of detection and limit of quantification were 7.15 × 10-13M and 2.38 × 10-12M, respectively. For the electrochemical study of ACV, the sensor demonstrated high accuracy, precision, robustness, and a short detection time. Furthermore, the developed electrochemical sensor exhibited exceptional recovery in tablet dosage form and commercial human blood samples, with recoveries of 99.40 and 100.44%, respectively. The findings showed that the AM-ACV@MIP/GCE sensor would effectively be used to directly assess pharmaceuticals from actual specimens and would particularly detect ACV compared to structurally similar pharmaceutical compounds.",

        "abstract": "Background:Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a progressive necrotizing retinitis caused by viral infection. Optimal management strategies have not been established for this detrimental disease. Previous literature published suggests that Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) are the most common promoters of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Aims:The purpose of our study was to investigate the viral distribution, demographic, and treatment outcomes of ARN. Methods:A retrospective chart review evaluated data from PCR-positive ARN patients diagnosed between 2009 and 2018. Results:Analysis of fourteen eyes from 12 patients found CMV and VZV as the commonest causes of ARN. Patients on 1 g of valacyclovir three times a day (V1T) had worse vision between first and final visits (mean difference of 1.25 ± 0.65, n = 2) compared with patients treated with 2 g of valacyclovir three times a day (V2T), or 900 mg twice a day of valganciclovir (V9B) (mean difference of - 0.067 ± 0.13, n = 6, and 0.067 ± 0.067, n = 6, respectively). Both V1T patients developed retinal detachments (RD). Both CMV patients treated with intravitreal triamcinolone developed ARN, elevated IOP, and one developed multiple RD. Conclusions:Our review found increased incidence of CMV-positive ARN. Patients with zone 1 disease had worse initial visual acuity. Moreover, patients had more favorable outcomes with V2T and V9B compared to V1T. CMV-positive patients clinically worsened after intravitreal steroid injections, further underscoring the value of a PCR diagnosis to tailor the patients' treatment plan accordingly.",

        "title": "Monoclonal Antibodies",
        "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are immunoglobulins that have a high degree of specificity (mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse dervied (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, bacterial diseases (such as anthrax) and viral infections (such as COVID-19). Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2022, more than 80 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies have been approved for use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis, herpes simplex, varicella zoster (shingles) and hepatitis B.",

        "abstract": "Background:Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) is an opportunistic fungus responsible for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in deeply immunocompromised patients and for pulmonary colonization in individuals with mild immunosuppression or impaired respiratory function. PCP and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) co-infections have been widely described whereas those involving other Herpesviruses (HVs) such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1 and -2), and Varicella zoster virus (VZV) remain scarce. To date, no data are available concerning HVs co-infections in P. jirovecii colonization. Methods:Our main objective was to evaluate the frequency of HVs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from patients with PCP or with pulmonary colonization. The secondary objective was to assess the relationship between HVs and the mortality rate in PCP patients. A retrospective single-center study over a seven-year period was conducted. All patients with P. jirovecii detected using PCR in a BALF sample and for whom a PCR assay for HVs detection was performed were included in the study. Results:One hundred and twenty-five patients were included, corresponding to 77 patients with PCP and 48 colonized patients. At least one HV was detected in 54/77 (70.1%) PCP patients and in 28/48 (58.3%) colonized patients. EBV was the most frequent in both groups. Furthermore, the 30-day survival rate in PCP patients was significantly lower with [EBV + CMV] co-infection than that with EBV co-infection, [EBV + HSV-1] co-infection and without HV co-infection. Conclusion:Our results show that the frequency of HV, alone or in combination is similar in PCP and colonization. They also suggest that [EBV + CMV] detection in BALF samples from PCP patients is associated with an increased mortality rate, underlying the significance to detect HVs in the course of PCP.",

        "abstract": "Background:The Biofire®FilmArray®Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) PCR panel covers 14 viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens and has been implemented in many institutions worldwide. Post-marketing studies indicate a reduced sensitivity and overutilization underscoring the need for a more targeted usage. The aim of our study is to describe the utilization of the ME panel and to develop a diagnostic-stewardship based decision rule. Materials:Adult patients, who underwent CSF analysis with the ME panel between August 2016 and June 2021 at the University Hospital Basel, were included. Demographic, clinical, microbiological, and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic health record. Factors associated with a positive ME panel result were identified, and a decision rule was developed to potentially optimize the diagnostic yield and reduce the number of unnecessary tests. Results:1,236 adult patients received at least one panel in the observed period, of whom 106 panels tested positive (8.6%). The most frequently observed pathogens were Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, 27%),Streptococcus pneumoniae(19%), Enterovirus (16%), Herpes simplex Virus 1/2 (16%), and Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6, 13%). Fever, vomiting, headache, and photophobia were more frequently present in test positive patients as were significantly higher CSF leukocytes and protein concentrations. When simulating a decision rule based on CSF leukocytes and protein concentration, only 35% of all patients would have qualified for a ME panel tests, thereby increasing the positivity rate to 22.7%. 10 of 106 positive ME panels would have been missed, only involving HHV-6 and VZV (6 and 4 cases, respectively). As these subjects were either severely immunocompromised or had clinical features of shingles we propose extending the testing algorithm by including those criteria. Conclusion:The ME panel positivity rate at our institution was similar as previously published. Our results highlight the need for diagnostic-stewardship interventions when utilizing this assay by implementing a stepwise approach based on a limited number of clinical and laboratory features. This decision rule may improve the pretest probability of a positive test result, increase the quality of test utilization, and reduce costs.",

        "abstract": "Background:VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and systemic inflammation, putting patients at risk for infections. This study comprehensively examines the prevalence of opportunistic infections in patients with VEXAS, evaluating their impact on clinical outcomes and potential preventive measures. Methods:Patients with confirmed VEXAS were included. Survival analysis and logistic regression were used to identify associations between opportunistic infections and mortality. Infection rates (IRs) forPneumocystis jiroveciipneumonia (PJP) and alphaherpesviruses were calculated over a prospective 8-month observation period in relationship to prophylaxis. Results:Of 94 patients with VEXAS, 6% developed PJP; 15% had alphaherpesvirus reactivation, with varicella zoster virus (VZV) being the most common herpesvirus; and 10% contracted a nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. Risk of death was significantly increased per month following a diagnosis of PJP (hazard ratio [HR], 72.41 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 13.67-533.70]) or NTM (HR, 29.09 [95% CI, 9.51-88.79]). Increased odds for death were also observed in patients with a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation (odds ratio [OR], 12.10 [95% CI, 1.29-114.80]) but not in patients with VZV (OR, 0.89 [95% CI, .30-2.59]). Prophylaxis for PJP (IR, 0.001 vs 0 per person-day,P< .01) and VZV (IR, 0.006 vs 0 per person-day,P= .04) markedly decreased infection rates with a number needed to treat of 4 and 7, respectively. Conclusions:Opportunistic infections are common in patients with VEXAS. Patients who develop PJP, HSV, or NTM are at increased risk for death. Prophylaxis against PJP and VZV is highly effective.",

Multiplex real-time PCR was done for Dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile, Zika, Enterovirus, Epstein Barr Virus, Herpes Simplex Virus, Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpesvirus 6, Parechovirus, Parvovirus B19, Varicella Zoster Virus, Scrub typhus, Rickettsia species, Leptospira, Salmonella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Plasmodium species and by ELISA for Mumps and Measles virus. Of the 3173 CSF samples, 461 (14.5%) were positive for JE. Of the 334 non-JE AES cases, 66.2% viz. Scrub typhus (25.7%), Mumps (19.5%), Measles (4.2%), Parvovirus B19 (3.9%) Plasmodium (2.7%), HSV 1 and 2 (2.4%), EBV and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2.1% each), Salmonella and HHV 6 (1.2% each) were predominant. Hence, an improved surveillance system and our suggested expanded testing algorithm can improve the diagnosis of potentially treatable infectious agents of AES in India.",

        "abstract": "Background:In the phase III POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2 trials, deucravacitinib, an oral selective allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor, was well tolerated and efficacious over 1 year in patients with psoriasis. Objective:To evaluate deucravacitinib safety and efficacy over 2 years in patients participating in the phase III trials. Methods:In the POETYK long-term extension (LTE), an ongoing phase IIIb open-label trial, adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who completed PSO-1 or PSO-2 receive deucravacitinib 6 mg once daily. Safety was assessed via adverse events (AEs) and laboratory parameter abnormalities. Efficacy endpoints, including ≥ 75% reduction from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) and static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear), were evaluated in patients originally randomized to deucravacitinib, patients who crossed over from placebo at week 16 and patients who achieved PASI 75 at week 24 (peak efficacy). Results:At data cutoff (1 October 2021), 1519 patients had received at least one dose of deucravacitinib; 79.0% and 39.9% had ≥ 52 weeks and ≥ 104 weeks of total deucravacitinib exposure, respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) per 100 person-years were similar at 1 year and 2 years for any AEs (229.2 vs. 154.4, respectively), serious AEs (5.7 vs. 6.1), discontinuations (4.4 vs. 2.8), deaths (0.2 vs. 0.4), serious infections (1.7 vs. 2.6), herpes zoster (0.9 vs. 0.8), major adverse cardiovascular events (0.3 vs. 0.4), venous thromboembolic events (0.2 vs. 0.1) and malignancies (1.0 vs. 0.9). EAIRs for COVID-19 infections were higher at 2 years than at 1 year (5.1 vs. 0.5) owing to the peak of the global COVID-19 pandemic occurring during the LTE. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline or trends were observed over 2 years in haematological, chemistry or lipid parameters. Clinical responses were maintained in patients who received continuous deu-cravacitinib treatment from baseline [PASI 75: week 52, 72.4%; week 112, 79.7%; sPGA 0/1: week 52, 57.9%; week 112, 61.1% (as observed)]. Responses at week 52 were also maintained in placebo crossovers and in week-24 PASI-75 responders. Conclusions:Deucravacitinib maintained efficacy and demonstrated consistent safety with no new safety signals observed through 2 years.",

        "abstract": "Background:Recent studies increasingly suggest that microbial infections and the immune responses they elicit play significant roles in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. This study uses Mendelian randomization (MR) and Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization (BWMR) to explore the causal relationships between immune antibody responses and four common skin diseases: psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD), rosacea, and vitiligo. Methods:We utilized summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for antibody responses to 13 infectious pathogens and four skin diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess causal relationships using multiple MR methods, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, and weighted median. BWMR was also employed to confirm findings and address potential pleiotropy. Results:The IVW analysis identified significant associations between specific antibody responses and the skin diseases studied. Key findings include protective associations of anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgG seropositivity and Helicobacter pylori UREA antibody levels with psoriasis and AD. anti-chlamydia trachomatis IgG seropositivity, anti-polyomavirus 2 IgG seropositivity, and varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E and I antibody levels were negatively associated with rosacea, while EBV Elevated levels of the early antigen (EA-D) antibody levels and HHV-6 IE1B antibody levels were positively associated with rosacea. H. pylori Catalase antibody levels were protectively associated with vitiligo, whereas anti-herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) IgG seropositivity was positively associated with vitiligo. The BWMR analysis confirmed these associations. Conclusion:This study underscores the significant role of H. pylori and other pathogens in these skin diseases, suggesting both protective and exacerbating effects depending on the specific condition. Understanding these pathogen-immune interactions can lead to the development of more effective, personalized treatments and preventative strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.",

However, in about 40% of cases, no virus is identified despite an extensive diagnostic workup. The aim of the present study was to analyze demographic, seasonal, and routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters in cases of viral ME and assess their utility for the prediction of the causative virus. Methods:Demographic data, season, and routine CSF parameters (total leucocytes, CSF cell differentiation, age-adjusted CSF/serum albumin ratio, and total immunoglobulin ratios) were retrospectively assessed in cases of viral ME. Results:In total, 156 cases of acute viral ME (74 female, median age 40.0 years) were treated at a tertiary-care hospital in Germany. Specific viral infections were detected in 93 (59.6%) cases. Of these, 14 (9.0%) cases were caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), 36 (23.1%) by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), 27 (17.3%) by enteroviruses, 9 (5.8%) by West Nile virus (WNV), and 7 (4.5%) by other specific viruses. Additionally, 64 (41.0%) cases of ME of unknown viral etiology were diagnosed. Cases of WNV ME were older, predominantly male, showed a severe disruption of the blood-CSF-barrier, a high proportion of neutrophils in CSF, and an intrathecal total immunoglobulin M synthesis in the first CSF sample. In a multinominal logistic regression analysis, the accuracy of these CSF parameters together with age and seasonality was best for the prediction of WNV (87.5%), followed by unknown viral etiology (66.7%), VZV (61.8%), and enteroviruses (51.9%). Conclusions:Cases with WNV ME showed a specific pattern of routine CSF parameters and demographic data that allowed for their identification with good accuracy. These findings might help to guide the diagnostic workup in cases with viral ME, in particular allowing the timely identification of cases with ME due to WNV.",

        "abstract": "Background:HPV vaccination prevents cancers, including 90% of cervical cancer. Since 2008, a school-based HPV vaccination program has been implemented in Quebec, but vaccine coverage is suboptimal. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted school-based vaccination programs. This study aimed to assess variation in HPV vaccination coverage in the school-based program between 2015 and 2022 in Quebec and to identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with non-vaccination. Methods:HPV vaccine coverage data were extracted from the Quebec Immunization Registry for students in Grade 4 and matched to the 2016 Canadian census sociodemographic data. Descriptive analysis was conducted to explore individual-level vaccine coverage according to sociodemographic data. A Generalized Estimating Equations model assessed the independent association between non-vaccination and students' sociodemographic characteristics. Results:HPV vaccine coverage (at least one dose) was 84% in 2018-2019 and 85% in 2019-2020. A decrease was observed during the pandemic. In 2020-2021, the HPV vaccine coverage (at least one dose) was 52% (at the end of the school year) and rose to 84% with intense catch-up activities. In 2021-2022, the coverage was slightly lower than before the pandemic (81%). Factors in the dissemination area were statistically significantly associated with non-vaccination: material (p-value = 0.0001) and social deprivation index (p-value = 0.0048), the proportion of immigration (p-value < 0.0001), and the language spoken at home (English (p-value = 0.0318), other than French or English (p-value = 0.0001). Conclusion:School-based vaccination programs offer equitable access to vaccination, and our analysis showed that some groups have consistently lower vaccine acceptance and uptake. Strategies to improve HPV vaccine coverage should target children living in areas with a higher proportion of immigrants, non-French speakers, and people from underprivileged backgrounds. Although it is too early to assess the full impact of COVID-19 on school-based programs in Quebec, it remains important to ensure that catch-up strategies are implemented for missed doses.",

        "abstract": "Oncolytic virotherapy aims to activate host antitumor immunity. In responsive tumors, intratumorally injected herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) have been shown to lyse tumor cells, resulting in local inflammation, enhanced tumor antigen presentation, and boosting of antitumor cytotoxic lymphocytes. In contrast to HSV, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is nonlytic and reprograms infected myeloid cells, limiting their antigen-presenting functions and protecting them from recognition by natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we show that when co-injected into mouse tumors with an oncolytic HSV, mouse CMV (mCMV) preferentially targeted tumor-associated myeloid cells, promoted the local release of proinflammatory cytokines, and enhanced systemic antitumor immune responses, leading to superior control of both injected and distant contralateral tumors. Deletion of mCMV genes m06, which degrades major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I), or m144, a viral MHC class I homolog that inhibits NK activation, was shown to diminish the antitumor activity of the HSV/mCMV combination. However, an mCMV recombinant lacking the m04 gene, which escorts MHC class I to the cell surface, showed superior HSV adjuvanticity. CMV is a potentially promising agent with which to reshape and enhance antitumor immune responses following oncolytic HSV therapy.",

        "abstract": "Our previous study showed that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may be the etiology for some patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS); hence, the current study aimed to investigate the urinary viral spectrum in patients with IC/BPS and the clinical efficacy of valacyclovir. Twenty-eight patients were prospectively enrolled for valacyclovir 500 mg twice a day for 4 weeks. Urine samples were collected from IC/BPS patients and 30 controls. The primary outcome was the difference in the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and secondary outcomes included changes in the urinary viral spectrum and urinary inflammatory cytokine level (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT05094414). Urinary EBV was detected in 14.2% IC/BPS patients but not in the controls. Urinary John Cunningham virus and BK virus were detected in 18 (64.3%) and 2 (7.1%) patients with IC/BPS, respectively, with similar prevalences noted for the controls. No cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, or herpes simplex virus was detected in the urine samples. The VAS pain score in patients with IC/BPS significantly decreased after 4 weeks (from 7.5 [5.52-9.0] to 5 [1.5-6.0],p= 0.0003). Urinary EBV was undetectable in any sample after valacyclovir treatment, and the decreases in urinary interleukin (IL)-1β (from 0.66 [0.55-0.82] pg/mL to 0.58 [0.55-0.64] pg/mL,p= 0.0034), IL-8 (from 6.81 [2.38 to 29.1] pg/mL to 4.33 [1.53-11.04] pg/mL,p= 0.0361), IL-10 (from 1.06 [0.94-1.18] pg/mL to 0.92 [0.88-1.02],p= 0.0086), and tumor necrosis factor-α (from 1.61 [1.50-1.72] pg/mL to 1.50 [1.44-1.55] pg/mL,p= 0.0079) were significant. Valacyclovir could relieve bladder pain, eliminate urinary EBV, and reduce bladder inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Background:Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Hereditary susceptibility and environmental factors contribute to disease risk. Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) have previously been associated with MS risk. Other neurotropic viruses, such as rubella virus (RV), are possible candidates in MS aetiopathogenesis, but previous results are limited and conflicting. Methods:In this nested case-control study of biobank samples in a Swedish cohort, we analysed the serological response towards RV before the clinical onset of MS with a bead-based multiplex assay in subjects vaccinated and unvaccinated towards RV. The association between RV seropositivity and MS risk was analysed with conditional logistic regression. Results:Seropositivity towards RV was associated with an increased risk of MS for unvaccinated subjects, even when adjusting for plausible confounders including EBV, HHV-6A, cytomegalovirus and vitamin D (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-8.8). Cases also had stronger antibody reactivity towards rubella than controls, which was not seen for other neurotropic viruses such as herpes simplex or varicella zoster. Furthermore, we observed an association between RV seropositivity and MS in vaccinated subjects. However, this association was not significant when adjusting for the aforementioned confounders (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.9). Conclusions:To our knowledge, these are the first reported associations between early RV seropositivity and later MS development. This suggests a broadening of the virus hypothesis in MS aetiology, where molecular mimicry between rubella epitopes and human central nervous system molecules could be an attractive possible mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Purpose:To identify the types of viral infection in aqueous humor (AqH) among patients diagnosed as Fuchs uveitis syndrome (FUS) or Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS) and investigate their relevance to clinical manifestations and visual outcome. Methods:A total of 375 patients and 171 patients were diagnosed as FUS or PSS in our department. AqH and serum samples from 68 FUS patients and 16 PSS patients were obtained during eye surgery. The viral etiologies, clinical features, auxiliary tests and visual prognosis of patients with FUS or PSS who underwent AqH analysis were analysed and compared. Results:Among 68 FUS patients, rubella virus (RV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus were identified in 17, 11, 1 and 1 patients, respectively. Seven patients with CMV and 1 with HSV were identified in 16 PSS patients. In both FUS and PSS groups, virus-associated eyes had higher proportion of secondary glaucoma and worse visual prognosis as compared with non-virus-associated eyes (all P < 0.05). In FUS group, specifically, CMV infection manifested as more obvious anterior segment inflammation and lower corneal endothelial cell density (CECD). RV infection showed a higher percentage of vitritis. In PSS group, CMV-associated PSS had a lower retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and CECD, worse visual prognosis as compared with non-virus-associated PSS (all P < 0.05). Conclusion:Our study identified 4 types of viral infection in FUS and 2 types of viral infection in PSS. Virus-associated patients are usually associated with more obvious clinical signs and poor visual prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Infection and lymphopenia are established bendamustine-related complications. The relationship between lymphopenia severity and infection risk, and the role of antimicrobial prophylaxis, is not well described. This multicentre retrospective study analysed infection characteristics and antimicrobial prophylaxis in 302 bendamustine-treated indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients. Lymphopenia (<1 × 109/L) was near universal and time to lymphocyte recovery correlated with cumulative bendamustine dose. No association between lymphopenia severity and duration with infection was observed. Infections occurred in 44% of patients (50% bacterial) with 27% hospitalised; 32% of infections occurred ≥3 months post bendamustine completion. Infection was associated with obinutuzumab and/or maintenance anti-CD20 therapy, prior therapy and advanced stage. Twenty-four opportunistic infections occurred in 21 patients: ten varicella zoster virus (VZV), seven herpes simplex virus (HSV), one cytomegalovirus, one progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, one nocardiosis, one Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) and three other fungal infections. VZV/HSV and PJP prophylaxis were prescribed to 42% and 54% respectively. Fewer VZV/HSV infections occurred in patients receiving prophylaxis (HR 0.14, p = 0.061) while PJP prophylaxis was associated with reduced risk of bacterial infection (HR 0.48, p = 0.004). Our study demonstrates a significant infection risk regardless of lymphopenia severity and supports prophylaxis to mitigate the risk of early and delayed infections.",

Case presentation:A 60-year-old male patient who presented anterior hypertensive uveitis followed by a new finding of a yellowish-white fluffy retinochoroidal lesion in the superior-temporal quadrant. He was initially treated with antiviral therapy without improvement. Next, due to theTginfection suspicion, anti-toxoplasmic treatment was added, and therapeutic and diagnostic vitrectomy was performed along with intravitreal clindamycin. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis in intraocular fluids confirmedTgandEBVcoinfection. Then, anti-Toxoplasmaoral treatment and antiviral and oral corticosteroids were administrated, achieving improvement. Conclusions:In a patient with atypical retinochoroidal lesions, an intraocular fluids PCR should be performed, in addition to the serological laboratories to rule out coinfection, confirm the diagnosis, and establish an appropriate treatment. Coinfection could impact the pathogenesis and prognosis of the disease.Abbreviations:OT: Ocular toxoplasmosis;Tg: Toxoplasma gondii; EBV:Epstein Barr Virus; CMV: Cytomegalovirus; HIV: Human Immunodeficiency Virus; HSV:Herpes Simplex Virus; VZV:Varicella Zoster Virus; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; OD: Right eye; OS: Left eye; BCVA: best-corrected visual acuity.",

        "abstract": "Background:COVID-19 is primarily considered a respiratory tract infection, but it can also affect the central nervous system (CNS), which can result in long-term sequelae. In contrast to CNS infections by classic neurotropic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is usually not detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with COVID-19 with neurological involvement (neuro-COVID), suggesting fundamental differences in pathogenesis. Methods:To assess differences in CNS metabolism in neuro-COVID compared to CNS infections with classic neurotropic viruses, we applied a targeted metabolomic analysis of 630 metabolites to CSF from patients with (i) COVID-19 with neurological involvement [n = 16, comprising acute (n = 13) and post-COVID-19 (n = 3)], (ii) viral meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis (n = 10) due to herpes simplex virus (n = 2), varicella zoster virus (n = 6), enterovirus (n = 1) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (n = 1), and (iii) aseptic neuroinflammation (meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis) of unknown etiology (n = 21) as additional disease controls. Results:Standard CSF parameters indicated absent or low neuroinflammation in neuro-COVID. Indeed, CSF cell count was low in neuro-COVID (median 1 cell/µL, range 0-12) and discriminated it accurately from viral CNS infections (AUC = 0.99) and aseptic neuroinflammation (AUC = 0.98). 32 CSF metabolites passed quality assessment and were included in the analysis. Concentrations of differentially abundant (fold change ≥|1.5|, FDR ≤ 0.05) metabolites were both higher (9 and 5 metabolites) and lower (2 metabolites) in neuro-COVID than in the other two groups. Concentrations of citrulline, ceramide (d18:1/18:0), and methionine were most significantly elevated in neuro-COVID. Remarkably, triglyceride TG(20:1_32:3) was much lower (mean fold change = 0.09 and 0.11) in neuro-COVID than in all viral CNS infections and most aseptic neuroinflammation samples, identifying it as highly accurate biomarker with AUC = 1 and 0.93, respectively. Across all samples, TG(20:1_32:3) concentration correlated only moderately with CSF cell count (ρ = 0.65), protein concentration (ρ = 0.64), and Q-albumin (ρ = 0.48), suggesting that its low levels in neuro-COVID CSF are only partially explained by less pronounced neuroinflammation. Conclusions:The results suggest that CNS metabolite responses in neuro-COVID differ fundamentally from viral CNS infections and aseptic neuroinflammation and may be used to discover accurate diagnostic biomarkers in CSF and to gain insights into differences in pathophysiology between neuro-COVID, viral CNS infections and aseptic neuroinflammation.",

        "abstract": "Acute retinal necrosis is a progressive intraocular inflammatory syndrome characterized by diffuse necrotizing retinitis that can lead to a poor visual outcome, mainly from retinal detachment. The antiviral treatment approach for acute retinal necrosis varies as there are no established guidelines. We summarize the outcomes of acute retinal necrosis with available antiviral treatments. Electronic searches were conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and Google Scholar for interventional and observational studies. Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the pooled proportion of the predefined selected outcomes. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022320987). Thirty-four studies with a total of 963 participants and 1,090 eyes were included in the final analysis. The estimated varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction-positive cases were 63% (95% CI: 55-71%) and 35% (95% CI: 28-42%), respectively. The 3 main antiviral treatment approaches identified were oral antivirals alone, intravenous antivirals alone, and a combination of systemic (oral or intravenous) and intravitreal antivirals. The overall pooled estimated proportions of visual acuity improvement, recurrence, and retinal detachment were 37% (95% CI: 27-47%), 14% (95% CI: 8-21%), and 43% (95% CI: 38-50%), respectively. Patients treated with systemic and intravitreal antivirals showed a trend towards better visual outcomes than those treated with systemic antivirals (oral or intravenous) alone, even though this analysis was not statistically significant (test for subgroup differences P = 0.83).",

        "abstract": "Background:Patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma are at increased risk of infection. Infections during treatment with teclistamab, the first B-cell maturation antigen-directed bispecific antibody approved for triple-class-exposed relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, was examined in the phase 1/2 MajesTEC-1 study. Methods:Patients (N = 165) received subcutaneous teclistamab 1.5 mg/kg weekly after a step-up dosing schedule (0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, each separated by 2-4 days). Patients were monitored frequently for infections; prophylaxis and management were per institutional guidelines. Results:At a median follow-up of 22.8 months (range, 0.3-33.6), infections were reported in 132 patients (80.0%). Grade 3/4 infections occurred in 91 patients (55.2%), including COVID-19 (21.2%), respiratory infections (19.4%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (4.2%), viral infections (4.2%), and gastrointestinal infections (1.2%). Twenty-one patients died from infections (18 from COVID-19). Median time to first onset of any-grade and grade 3 to 5 infections was 1.7 and 4.2 months, respectively. Overall, 70.9% of patients had ≥1 postbaseline immunoglobulin G (IgG) level <400 mg/dL; median time to IgG <400 mg/dL was 1.2 months (range, 0.2-19.8) and 46.1% received ≥1 dose of IgG replacement. Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 65.5% of patients (median time to grade ≥3 neutropenia/febrile neutropenia was 2.3 months [range, 0-18.1]). Conclusion:Based on the infection profile of B-cell maturation antigen-targeted bispecific antibodies such as teclistamab, it is recommended that clinicians and patients remain vigilant for a range of infection types throughout treatment to facilitate prompt intervention. Appropriate screening, prophylaxis, and management of infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, and neutropenia are important. Clinical trial registration:NCT03145181/NCT04557098 (ClinicalTrials.gov) PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Before starting teclistamab, patients should be up to date with vaccinations (including COVID-19) and screened for hepatitis B and C and HIV. Teclistamab should not be given to patients with any active infections. Prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered per institutional guidelines. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and herpes simplex/varicella zoster virus is recommended during teclistamab treatment. Close monitoring of infections and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels should continue throughout teclistamab treatment. IgG replacement (administered every 3-6 weeks) should be used to maintain IgG ≥400 mg/dL. Growth factors should be considered for grade ≥3 neutropenia with infection/fever and grade 4 neutropenia.",
